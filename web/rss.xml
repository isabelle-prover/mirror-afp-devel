In this submission array-based binary minimum heaps are formalized.
The correctness of the following heap operations is proved: insert,
get-min, delete-min and make-heap. These are then used to verify an
in-place heapsort. The formalization is based on IMP2, an imperative
program verification framework implemented in Isabelle/HOL. The
verified heap functions are iterative versions of the partly recursive
functions found in &#34;Algorithms and Data Structures – The Basic
Toolbox&#34; by K. Mehlhorn and P. Sanders and &#34;Introduction to
Algorithms&#34; by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and C.

Authenticated data structures are a technique for outsourcing data
storage and maintenance to an untrusted server. The server is required
to produce an efficiently checkable and cryptographically secure proof
that it carried out precisely the requested computation. &lt;a
href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/2535838.2535851&#34;&gt;Miller et
al.&lt;/a&gt; introduced &amp;lambda;&amp;bull; (pronounced
&lt;i&gt;lambda auth&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;mdash;a functional programming
language with a built-in primitive authentication construct, which
supports a wide range of user-specified authenticated data structures
while guaranteeing certain correctness and security properties for all
well-typed programs. We formalize &amp;lambda;&amp;bull; and prove its
correctness and security properties. With Isabelle&#39;s help, we
uncover and repair several mistakes in the informal proofs and lemma
statements. Our findings are summarized in a &lt;a

We use CryptHOL to consider Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols.
MPC was first considered by Yao in 1983 and recent advances in
efficiency and an increased demand mean it is now deployed in the real
world. Security is considered using the real/ideal world paradigm. We
first define security in the semi-honest security setting where
parties are assumed not to deviate from the protocol transcript. In
this setting we prove multiple Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocols
secure and then show security for the gates of the GMW protocol. We
then define malicious security, this is a stronger notion of security
where parties are assumed to be fully corrupted by an adversary. In
this setting we again consider OT, as it is a fundamental building
block of almost all MPC protocols.</description>

This is a complete formalization of the work of Hoare and Roscoe on
the denotational semantics of the Failure/Divergence Model of CSP. It
follows essentially the presentation of CSP in Roscoe’s Book ”Theory
and Practice of Concurrency” [8] and the semantic details in a joint
Paper of Roscoe and Brooks ”An improved failures model for
communicating processes&#34;.  The present work is based on a prior
formalization attempt, called HOL-CSP 1.0, done in 1997 by H. Tej and
B. Wolff with the Isabelle proof technology available at that time.
This work revealed minor, but omnipresent foundational errors in key
concepts like the process invariant. The present version HOL-CSP
profits from substantially improved libraries (notably HOLCF),
improved automated proof techniques, and structured proof techniques
in Isar and is substantially shorter but more complete.</description>

We present a formalisation of the unified translation approach of
linear temporal logic (LTL) into ω-automata from [1]. This approach
decomposes LTL formulas into ``simple&#39;&#39; languages and allows
a clear separation of concerns: first, we formalise the purely logical
result yielding this decomposition; second, we instantiate this
generic theory to obtain a construction for deterministic
(state-based) Rabin automata (DRA). We extract from this particular
instantiation an executable tool translating LTL to DRAs. To the best
of our knowledge this is the first verified translation from LTL to
DRAs that is proven to be double exponential in the worst case which
asymptotically matches the known lower bound.

We formalize a theory of syntax with bindings that has been developed
and refined over the last decade to support several large
formalization efforts. Terms are defined for an arbitrary number of
constructors of varying numbers of inputs, quotiented to
alpha-equivalence and sorted according to a binding signature. The
theory includes many properties of the standard operators on terms:
substitution, swapping and freshness. It also includes bindings-aware
induction and recursion principles and support for semantic
interpretation. This work has been presented in the ITP 2017 paper “A
Formalized General Theory of Syntax with Bindings”.</description>

We formalize the proofs of two transcendence criteria by J. Hančl
and P. Rucki that assert the transcendence of the sums of certain
infinite series built up by sequences that fulfil certain properties.
Both proofs make use of Roth&#39;s celebrated theorem on diophantine
approximations to algebraic numbers from 1955  which we implement as
an assumption without having formalised its proof.</description>

We formalize quantum Hoare logic as given in [1]. In particular, we
specify the syntax and denotational semantics of a simple model of
quantum programs. Then, we write down the rules of quantum Hoare logic
for partial correctness, and show the soundness and completeness of
the resulting proof system. As an application, we verify the

&lt;p&gt;The theory is a formalization of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/&#34;&gt;OCL&lt;/a&gt; type system, its abstract
syntax and expression typing rules. The theory does not define a concrete
syntax and a semantics. In contrast to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Featherweight_OCL.html&#34;&gt;Featherweight OCL&lt;/a&gt;,
it is based on a deep embedding approach. The type system is defined from scratch,
it is not based on the Isabelle HOL type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Safe OCL distincts nullable and non-nullable types. Also the theory gives a
formal definition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1512/paper07.pdf&#34;&gt;safe
navigation operations&lt;/a&gt;. The Safe OCL typing rules are much stricter than rules
given in the OCL specification. It allows one to catch more errors on a type
checking phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type theory presented is four-layered: classes, basic types, generic types,
errorable types. We introduce the following new types: non-nullable types (T[1]),
nullable types (T[?]), OclSuper. OclSuper is a supertype of all other types (basic
types, collections, tuples). This type allows us to define a total supremum function,
so types form an upper semilattice. It allows us to define rich expression typing
rules in an elegant manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Preliminaries Chapter of the theory defines a number of helper lemmas for
transitive closures and tuples. It defines also a generic object model independent
from OCL. It allows one to use the theory as a reference for formalization of analogous languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

can be shown in an elementary way (i.&amp;thinsp;e. without the Prime
Number Theorem), the various equivalent forms of the PNT (which imply
each other in elementary ways), and consequences that follow from the
PNT in elementary ways. The latter include, most notably, asymptotic

This Isabelle/HOL formalization defines a greedy algorithm for finding
a minimum weight basis on a weighted matroid and proves its
correctness. This algorithm is an abstract version of Kruskal&#39;s
algorithm.  We interpret the abstract algorithm for the cycle matroid
(i.e. forests in a graph) and refine it to imperative executable code
using an efficient union-find data structure.  Our formalization can
be instantiated for different graph representations. We provide
instantiations for undirected graphs and symmetric directed graphs.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The most efficient known primality tests are
&lt;em&gt;probabilistic&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that they use
randomness and may, with some probability, mistakenly classify a
composite number as prime &amp;ndash; but never a prime number as
composite. Examples of this are the Miller&amp;ndash;Rabin test, the
Solovay&amp;ndash;Strassen test, and (in most cases) Fermat&#39;s
test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This entry defines these three tests and
proves their correctness. It also develops some of the
number-theoretic foundations, such as Carmichael numbers and the
Jacobi symbol with an efficient executable algorithm to compute
it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Isabelle/UTP is a mechanised theory engineering toolkit based on Hoare
and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). UTP enables the
creation of denotational, algebraic, and operational semantics for
different programming languages using an alphabetised relational
calculus. We provide a semantic embedding of the alphabetised
relational calculus in Isabelle/HOL, including new type definitions,
relational constructors, automated proof tactics, and accompanying
algebraic laws. Isabelle/UTP can be used to both capture laws of
programming for different languages, and put these fundamental
theorems to work in the creation of associated verification tools,
using calculi like Hoare logics. This document describes the
relational core of the UTP in Isabelle/HOL.</description>

We formalize a proof of Motzkin&#39;s transposition theorem and
Farkas&#39; lemma in Isabelle/HOL. Our proof is based on the
formalization of the simplex algorithm which, given a set of linear
constraints, either returns a satisfying assignment to the problem or
detects unsatisfiability. By reusing facts about the simplex algorithm
we show that a set of linear constraints is unsatisfiable if and only
if there is a linear combination of the constraints which evaluates to
a trivially unsatisfiable inequality.</description>

       <description>
IMP2 is a simple imperative language together with Isabelle tooling to
create a program verification environment in Isabelle/HOL. The tools
include a C-like syntax, a verification condition generator, and
Isabelle commands for the specification of programs. The framework is
modular, i.e., it allows easy reuse of already proved programs within
larger programs.  This entry comes with a quickstart guide and a large
collection of examples, spanning basic algorithms with simple proofs
to more advanced algorithms and proof techniques like data refinement.
Some highlights from the examples are: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bisection
Square Root, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extended Euclid,  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exponentiation by Squaring,  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Binary
Search,  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insertion Sort,  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quicksort,  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Depth First Search.
&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  The abstract syntax and semantics are very
simple and well-documented. They are suitable to be used in a course,
as extension to the IMP language which comes with the Isabelle
distribution.  While this entry is limited to a simple imperative
language, the ideas could be extended to more sophisticated languages.</description>

       <description>
In this formalization, I introduce a higher-order term algebra,
generalizing the notions of free variables, matching, and
substitution. The need arose from the work on a &lt;a
href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-89884-1_35&#34;&gt;verified
compiler from Isabelle to CakeML&lt;/a&gt;. Terms can be thought of as
consisting of a generic (free variables, constants, application) and
a specific part. As example applications, this entry provides
instantiations for de-Bruijn terms, terms with named variables, and
&lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Lambda_Free_RPOs.html&#34;&gt;Blanchette’s
&amp;lambda;-free higher-order terms&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, I
implement translation functions between de-Bruijn terms and named
terms and prove their correctness.</description>

       <description>
When verifying a concurrent program, it is usual to assume that memory
is sequentially consistent.  However, most modern multiprocessors
depend on store buffering for efficiency, and provide native
sequential consistency only at a substantial performance penalty.  To
regain sequential consistency, a programmer has to follow an
appropriate programming discipline. However, na&amp;iuml;ve disciplines,
such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not flexible
enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software.  We
present a new discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total
store order, with store buffer forwarding). It does not depend on
concurrency primitives, such as locks. Instead, threads use ghost
operations to acquire and release ownership of memory addresses. A
thread can write to an address only if no other thread owns it, and
can read from an address only if it owns it or it is shared and the
thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an address
it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency
(where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency
(where atomic operations race to memory).  We formalize this
discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every execution of a
program in a system without store buffers follows the discipline, then
every execution of the program with store buffers is sequentially
consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by
ordinary assertional reasoning about the program, without having to
consider store buffers at all.</description>

In this AFP entry, we formalize the core of the Document Object Model
(DOM).  At its core, the DOM defines a tree-like data structure for
representing documents in general and HTML documents in particular. It
is the heart of any modern web browser.  Formalizing the key concepts
of the DOM is a prerequisite for the formal reasoning over client-side
JavaScript programs and for the analysis of security concepts in
modern web browsers.  We present a formalization of the core DOM, with
focus on the node-tree and the operations defined on node-trees, in
Isabelle/HOL. We use the formalization to verify the functional
correctness of the most important functions defined in the DOM
standard. Moreover, our formalization is 1) extensible, i.e., can be
extended without the need of re-proving already proven properties and
2) executable, i.e., we can generate executable code from our
specification.</description>

       <description>
Concurrent revisions is a concurrency control model developed by
Microsoft Research. It has many interesting properties that
distinguish it from other well-known models such as transactional
memory. One of these properties is &lt;em&gt;determinacy&lt;/em&gt;:
programs written within the model always produce the same outcome,
independent of scheduling activity. The concurrent revisions model has
an operational semantics, with an informal proof of determinacy. This
document contains an Isabelle/HOL formalization of this semantics and
the proof of determinacy.</description>

       <title>Verifying Imperative Programs using Auto2</title>

This entry contains the application of auto2 to verifying functional
and imperative programs. Algorithms and data structures that are
verified include linked lists, binary search trees, red-black trees,
interval trees, priority queue, quicksort, union-find, Dijkstra&#39;s
algorithm, and a sweep-line algorithm for detecting rectangle
intersection. The imperative verification is based on Imperative HOL
and its separation logic framework. A major goal of this work is to
set up automation in order to reduce the length of proof that the user
needs to provide, both for verifying functional programs and for
working with separation logic.</description>

       <description>
Inspired by Abstract Cryptography, we extend CryptHOL, a framework for
formalizing game-based proofs, with an abstract model of Random
Systems and provide proof rules about their composition and equality.
This foundation facilitates the formalization of Constructive
Cryptography proofs, where the security of a cryptographic scheme is
realized as a special form of construction in which a complex random
system is built from simpler ones. This is a first step towards a
fully-featured compositional framework, similar to Universal
Composability framework, that supports formalization of
simulation-based proofs.</description>

These mathematical components formalise predicate transformer
semantics for programs, yet currently only for partial correctness and
in the absence of faults.  A first part for isotone (or monotone),
Sup-preserving and Inf-preserving transformers follows Back and von
Wright&#39;s approach, with additional emphasis on the quantalic
structure of algebras of transformers.  The second part develops
Sup-preserving and Inf-preserving predicate transformers from the
powerset monad, via its Kleisli category and Eilenberg-Moore algebras,
with emphasis on adjunctions and dualities, as well as isomorphisms
between relations, state transformers and predicate transformers.</description>

These components add further fundamental order and lattice-theoretic
concepts and properties to Isabelle&#39;s libraries.  They follow by
and large the introductory sections of the Compendium of Continuous
Lattices,  covering directed and filtered sets, down-closed and
up-closed sets, ideals and filters, Galois connections, closure and
co-closure operators. Some emphasis is on duality and morphisms
between structures, as in the Compendium.  To this end, three ad-hoc
approaches to duality are compared.</description>

       <description>
This is an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of graph saturation, closely
following a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.005&#34;&gt;paper by the author&lt;/a&gt; on graph saturation.
Nine out of ten lemmas of the original paper are proven in this
formalisation. The formalisation additionally includes two theorems
that show the main premise of the paper: that consistency and
entailment are decided through graph saturation. This formalisation
does not give executable code, and it did not implement any of the
optimisations suggested in the paper.</description>

This Isabelle/HOL formalization refines the abstract ordered
resolution prover  presented in Section 4.3 of Bachmair and
Ganzinger&#39;s &#34;Resolution Theorem Proving&#34; chapter in the
&lt;i&gt;Handbook of Automated Reasoning&lt;/i&gt;. The result is a
functional implementation of a first-order prover.</description>

Auto2 is a saturation-based heuristic prover for higher-order logic,
implemented as a tactic in Isabelle.  This entry contains the
instantiation of auto2 for Isabelle/HOL, along with two basic
examples: solutions to some of the Pelletier’s problems, and
elementary number theory of primes.</description>
