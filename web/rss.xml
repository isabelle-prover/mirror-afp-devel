This entry formalises the fast iterative algorithm for computing dominators
due to Cooper, Harvey and Kennedy. It gives a specification of computing
dominators on a control
flow graph where each node refers to its reverse post order number. A
semilattice of reversed-ordered list which represents dominators is
built and a Kildall-style algorithm on the semilattice is defined for
computing dominators. Finally the soundness and completeness of the
algorithm are proved w.r.t. the specification.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We formalize Cardano&#39;s formula to solve a cubic equation
$$ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0,$$ as well as Ferrari&#39;s formula to
solve a quartic equation. We further turn both formulas into
executable algorithms based on the algebraic number implementation in
the AFP. To this end we also slightly extended this library, namely by
making the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number executable, and
by defining and implementing $n$-th roots of complex
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the context of formal cryptographic protocol verification,
logging-independent message anonymity is the property for a given
message to remain anonymous despite the attacker&#39;s capability of
mapping messages of that sort to agents based on some intrinsic
feature of such messages, rather than by logging the messages
exchanged by legitimate agents as with logging-dependent message
anonymity.
This paper illustrates how logging-independent message
anonymity can be formalized according to the relational method for
formal protocol verification by considering a real-world protocol,
namely the Restricted Identification one by the BSI. This sample model
is used to verify that the pseudonymous identifiers output by user
identification tokens remain anonymous under the expected conditions.</description>

The Descartes test based on Bernstein coefficients and Descartes’ rule
of signs effectively (over-)approximates the number of real roots of a
univariate polynomial over an interval. In this entry we formalise the
theorem of three circles, which gives sufficient conditions for when
the Descartes test returns 0 or 1. This is the first step for
efficient root isolation.</description>

Combinatorial design theory studies incidence set systems with certain
balance and symmetry properties. It is closely related to hypergraph
theory. This formalisation presents a general library for formal
reasoning on incidence set systems, designs and their applications,
including formal definitions and proofs for many key properties,
operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs.
Notably, this includes formalising t-designs, balanced incomplete
block designs (BIBD), group divisible designs (GDD), pairwise balanced
designs (PBD), design isomorphisms, and the relationship between
graphs and designs. A locale-centric approach has been used to manage
the relationships between the many different types of designs.
Theorems of particular interest include the necessary conditions for
existence of a BIBD, Wilson&#39;s construction on GDDs, and
Bose&#39;s inequality on resolvable designs. Parts of this
formalisation are explored in the paper &#34;A Modular First
Formalisation of Combinatorial Design Theory&#34;, presented at CICM 2021.</description>

We study second-order formalisations of graph properties expressed as
first-order formulas in relation algebras extended with a Kleene star.
The formulas quantify over relations while still avoiding
quantification over elements of the base set. We formalise the
property of undirected graphs being acyclic this way. This involves a
study of various kinds of orientation of graphs. We also verify basic
algorithms to constructively prove several second-order properties.</description>

SpecCheck is a &lt;a
href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck&#34;&gt;QuickCheck&lt;/a&gt;-like
testing framework for Isabelle/ML. You can use it to write
specifications for ML functions. SpecCheck then checks whether your
specification holds by testing your function against a given number of
generated inputs. It helps you to identify bugs by printing
counterexamples on failure and provides you timing information.
SpecCheck is customisable and allows you to specify your own input
generators, test output formats, as well as pretty printers and
shrinking functions for counterexamples among other things.</description>

       <description>
This article formalises the proof of Van der Waerden&#39;s Theorem
from Ramsey theory.  Van der Waerden&#39;s Theorem states that for
integers $k$ and $l$ there exists a number $N$ which guarantees that
if an integer interval of length at least $N$ is coloured with $k$
colours, there will always be an arithmetic progression of length $l$
of the same colour in said interval. The proof goes along the lines of
\cite{Swan}.  The smallest number $N_{k,l}$ fulfilling Van der
Waerden&#39;s Theorem is then called the Van der Waerden Number.
Finding the Van der Waerden Number is still an open problem for most
values of $k$ and $l$.</description>

       <description>
MiniSail is a kernel language for Sail, an instruction set
architecture (ISA) specification language. Sail is an imperative
language with a light-weight dependent type system similar to
refinement type systems. From an ISA specification, the Sail compiler
can generate theorem prover code and C (or OCaml) to give an
executable emulator for an architecture. The idea behind MiniSail is
to capture the key and novel features of Sail in terms of their
syntax, typing rules and operational semantics, and to confirm that
they work together by proving progress and preservation lemmas. We use
the Nominal2 library to handle binding.</description>

       <description>
This paper presents a compiler correctness proof for the didactic
imperative programming language IMP, introduced in Nipkow and
Klein&#39;s book on formal programming language semantics (version of
March 2021), whose size is just two thirds of the book&#39;s proof in
the number of formal text lines. As such, it promises to constitute a
further enhanced reference for the formal verification of compilers
meant for larger, real-world programming languages.  The presented
proof does not depend on language determinism, so that the proposed
approach can be applied to non-deterministic languages as well. As a
confirmation, this paper extends IMP with an additional
non-deterministic choice command, and proves compiler correctness,
viz. the simulation of compiled code execution by source code, for
such extended language.</description>

Lyndon words are words lexicographically minimal in their conjugacy
class. We formalize their basic properties and characterizations, in
particular the concepts of the longest Lyndon suffix and the Lyndon
factorization. Most of the work assumes a fixed lexicographical order.
Nevertheless we also define the smallest relation guaranteeing
lexicographical minimality of a given word (in its conjugacy class).</description>

Graph lemma quantifies the defect effect of a system of word

system. We formalize the proof based on the decomposition of a

We formalize basics of Combinatorics on Words. This is an extension of
existing theories on lists. We provide additional properties related
to prefix, suffix, factor, length and rotation. The topics include
prefix and suffix comparability, mismatch, word power, total and
reversed morphisms, border, periods, primitivity and roots. We also
formalize basic, mostly folklore results related to word equations:
equidivisibility, commutation and conjugation. Slightly advanced
properties include the Periodicity lemma (often cited as the Fine and
Wilf theorem) and the variant of the Lyndon-Schützenberger theorem for
words. We support the algebraic point of view which sees words as
generators of submonoids of a free monoid. This leads to the concepts
of the (free) hull, the (free) basis (or code).</description>

This development provides a general definition for safe Regression
Test Selection (RTS) algorithms. RTS algorithms select which tests to
rerun on revised code, reducing the time required to check for newly
introduced errors. An RTS algorithm is considered safe if and only if
all deselected tests would have unchanged results.  This definition is
instantiated with two class-collection-based RTS algorithms run over
the JVM as modeled by JinjaDCI. This is achieved with a general
definition for Collection Semantics, small-step semantics instrumented
to collect information during execution. As the RTS definition
mandates safety, these instantiations include proofs of safety.  This
work is described in Mansky and Gunter&#39;s LSFA 2020 paper and
Mansky&#39;s doctoral thesis (UIUC, 2020).</description>

Furthermore, we define a language of proof terms and an executable

formalization is intentionally kept close to the Isabelle
implementation(for example using de Brujin indices) to enable easy
integration of generated code with the Isabelle system without a
complicated translation layer.  The formalization is described in our

We formalize the univariate case of Ben-Or, Kozen, and Reif&#39;s
decision procedure for first-order real arithmetic (the BKR
algorithm). We also formalize the univariate case of Renegar&#39;s
variation of the BKR algorithm. The two formalizations differ
mathematically in minor ways (that have significant impact on the
multivariate case), but are quite similar in proof structure.  Both
rely on sign-determination (finding the set of consistent sign
assignments for a set of polynomials).  The method used for
sign-determination is similar to Tarski&#39;s original quantifier
elimination algorithm (it stores key information in a matrix
equation), but with a reduction step to keep complexity low.</description>

This is a formalisation of the main result of Gale and Stewart from
1953, showing that closed finite games are determined. This property
is now known as the Gale Stewart Theorem. While the original paper
shows some additional theorems as well, we only formalize this main
result, but do so in a somewhat general way. We formalize games of a
fixed arbitrary length, including infinite length, using co-inductive
lists, and show that defensive strategies exist unless the other
player is winning. For closed games, defensive strategies are winning
for the closed player, proving that such games are determined. For
finite games, which are a special case in our formalisation, all games
are closed.</description>

       <description>
Large-scale stream processing systems often follow the dataflow
paradigm, which enforces a program structure that exposes a high
degree of parallelism. The Timely Dataflow distributed system supports
expressive cyclic dataflows for which it offers low-latency data- and
pipeline-parallel stream processing. To achieve high expressiveness
and performance, Timely Dataflow uses an intricate distributed
protocol for tracking the computation’s progress. We formalize this
progress tracking protocol and verify its safety. Our formalization is
described in detail in our forthcoming &lt;a

       <description>
We provide a characterisation of how information is propagated by
program executions based on the tracking data and control dependencies
within executions themselves.  The characterisation might be used for
deriving approximative safety properties to be targeted by static
analyses or checked at runtime.  We utilise a simple yet versatile
control flow graph model as a program representation.  As our model is
not assumed to be finite it can be instantiated for a broad class of
programs.  The targeted security property is indistinguishable
security where executions produce sequences of observations and only
non-terminating executions are allowed to drop a tail of those.  A
very crude approximation of our characterisation is slicing based on
program dependence graphs, which we use as a minimal example and
derive a corresponding soundness result.  For further details and
applications refer to the authors upcoming dissertation.</description>

We formalize mainstream structures in algebraic geometry culminating
in Grothendieck&#39;s schemes: presheaves of rings, sheaves of rings,
ringed spaces, locally ringed spaces, affine schemes and schemes. We
prove that the spectrum of a ring is a locally ringed space, hence an
affine scheme. Finally, we prove that any affine scheme is a scheme.</description>

We formalize the ring of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-adic integers within the framework of the
HOL-Algebra library. The carrier of the ring is formalized as the
inverse limit of quotients of the integers by powers of a fixed prime
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. We define an integer-valued valuation, as well as an
extended-integer valued valuation which sends 0 to the infinite
element. Basic topological facts about the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-adic integers are
formalized, including completeness and sequential compactness. Taylor
expansions of polynomials over a commutative ring are defined,
culminating in the formalization of Hensel&#39;s Lemma based on a
proof due to Keith Conrad.</description>

2016&lt;/a&gt;] introduces an abstract approach to composable security
statements that allows one to focus on a particular aspect of security
proofs at a time. Instead of proving the properties of concrete
systems, CC studies system classes, i.e., the shared behavior of
similar systems, and their transformations.  Modeling of systems
communication plays a crucial role in composability and reusability of
security statements; yet, this aspect has not been studied in any of
the existing CC results. We extend our previous CC formalization

       <description>
We verify two algorithms for which modular arithmetic plays an
essential role: Storjohann&#39;s variant of the LLL lattice basis
reduction algorithm and Kopparty&#39;s algorithm for computing the
Hermite normal form of a matrix. To do this, we also formalize some
facts about the modulo operation with symmetric range. Our
implementations are based on the original papers, but are otherwise
efficient. For basis reduction we formalize two versions: one that
includes all of the optimizations/heuristics from Storjohann&#39;s
paper, and one excluding a heuristic that we observed to often
decrease efficiency. We also provide a fast, self-contained certifier
for basis reduction, based on the efficient Hermite normal form
algorithm.</description>

This work contains a formalization of quantum projective measurements,
also known as von Neumann measurements, which are based on elements of
spectral theory. We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality
involving expectations in a probability space that is violated by
quantum measurements, thus proving that quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory.</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a formalisation of the
Hermite-Lindemann-Weierstraß Theorem (also known as simply
Hermite-Lindemann or Lindemann-Weierstraß). This theorem is one of the
crowning achievements of 19th century number theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theorem states that if $\alpha_1, \ldots,
\alpha_n\in\mathbb{C}$ are algebraic numbers that are linearly
independent over $\mathbb{Z}$, then $e^{\alpha_1},\ldots,e^{\alpha_n}$
are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66107-0_5&#34;&gt;previous
formalisation in Coq by Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, I proceeded by formalising
&lt;a
href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511565977&#34;&gt;Baker&#39;s
version of the theorem and proof&lt;/a&gt; and then deriving the
original one from that. Baker&#39;s version states that for any
algebraic numbers $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n\in\mathbb{C}$ and distinct
algebraic numbers $\alpha_i, \ldots, \alpha_n\in\mathbb{C}$, we have
$\beta_1 e^{\alpha_1} + \ldots + \beta_n e^{\alpha_n} = 0$ if and only
if all the $\beta_i$ are zero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has a number of
direct corollaries, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;$e$ and $\pi$
are transcendental&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$e^z$, $\sin z$, $\tan z$,
etc. are transcendental for algebraic
$z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;$\ln z$ is
transcendental for algebraic $z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,
1\}$&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description>
