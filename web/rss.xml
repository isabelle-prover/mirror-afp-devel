       <description>
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is often used to show that the
problem of finding a string &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; in a text
&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; can be solved deterministically in
&lt;i&gt;O(|s| + |t|)&lt;/i&gt; time. We use the Isabelle
Refinement Framework to formulate and verify the algorithm. Via
refinement, we apply some optimisations and finally use the
&lt;em&gt;Sepref&lt;/em&gt; tool to obtain executable code in
&lt;em&gt;Imperative/HOL&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

       <description>
Stochastic matrices are a convenient way to model discrete-time and
finite state Markov chains. The Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem
tells us something about the existence and uniqueness of non-negative
eigenvectors of a stochastic matrix.  In this entry, we formalize
stochastic matrices, link the formalization to the existing AFP-entry
on Markov chains, and apply the Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem to
prove that stationary distributions always exist, and they are unique
if the stochastic matrix is irreducible.</description>

We provide our Isabelle/HOL formalization of a Conflict-free
Replicated Datatype for Internet Message Access Protocol commands.
We show that Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) is guaranteed
by proving the commutativity of concurrent operations. We base our
formalization on the recently proposed &#34;framework for
establishing Strong Eventual Consistency for Conflict-free Replicated
Datatypes&#34; (AFP.CRDT) from Gomes et al. Hence, we provide an
additional example of how the recently proposed framework can be used
to design and prove CRDTs.</description>

We present a semantic embedding of a spatio-temporal multi-modal
logic, specifically defined to reason about motorway traffic, into
Isabelle/HOL. The semantic model is an abstraction of a motorway,
emphasising local spatial properties, and parameterised by the types
of sensors deployed in the vehicles. We use the logic to define
controller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the absence of
collisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive
definition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to
amend the controller constraints to still guarantee safety.</description>

We discuss a topological curiosity discovered by Kuratowski (1922):
the fact that the number of distinct operators on a topological space
generated by compositions of closure and complement never exceeds 14,
and is exactly 14 in the case of R. In addition, we prove a theorem
due to Chagrov (1982) that classifies topological spaces according to
the number of such operators they support.</description>

This entry provides a very abstract theory of transition systems that
can be instantiated to express various types of automata. A transition
system is typically instantiated by providing a set of initial states,
a predicate for enabled transitions, and a transition execution
function. From this, it defines the concepts of finite and infinite
paths as well as the set of reachable states, among other things. Many
useful theorems, from basic path manipulation rules to coinduction and
run construction rules, are proven in this abstract transition system
context. The library comes with instantiations for DFAs, NFAs, and
Büchi automata.</description>

Complementation. The verification is done in three steps: &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of odd rankings and proof that an automaton

&lt;li&gt;Definition of the complement automaton and proof that it

In complex analysis, the winding number measures the number of times a
path (counterclockwise) winds around a point, while the Cauchy index
can approximate how the path winds. This entry provides a
formalisation of the Cauchy index, which is then shown to be related
to the winding number. In addition, this entry also offers a tactic
that enables users to evaluate the winding number by calculating
Cauchy indices.</description>

roots (with multiplicity) of a polynomial within a rectangle box or a
half-plane. Potential applications of this entry include certified
complex root isolation (of a polynomial) and testing the Routh-Hurwitz
stability criterion (i.e., to check whether all the roots of some
characteristic polynomial have negative real parts).</description>

       <description>
We formalize the theory of homogeneous linear diophantine equations,
focusing on two main results: (1) an abstract characterization of
minimal complete sets of solutions, and (2) an algorithm computing
them. Both, the characterization and the algorithm are based on
previous work by Huet. Our starting point is a simple but inefficient
variant of Huet&#39;s lexicographic algorithm incorporating improved
bounds due to Clausen and Fortenbacher. We proceed by proving its
soundness and completeness. Finally, we employ code equations to
obtain a reasonably efficient implementation. Thus, we provide a
formally verified solver for homogeneous linear diophantine equations.</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt; This entry builds upon the results about formal and analytic
Dirichlet series to define the Hurwitz &amp;zeta; function and, based
on that, the Riemann &amp;zeta; function. This is done by first
defining them for &amp;real;(&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) &gt; 1 and then
successively extending the domain to the left using the
Euler&amp;ndash;MacLaurin formula. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some basic
results about these functions are also shown, such as their
analyticity on &amp;#8450;&amp;#8726;&amp;#123;1&amp;#125;, that they
have a simple pole with residue 1 at 1, their relation to the
&amp;Gamma; function, and the special values at negative integers and
positive even integers &amp;ndash; including the famous &amp;zeta;(-1)
= -1/12 and &amp;zeta;(2) = &amp;pi;&amp;sup2;/6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Lastly, the entry also contains Euler&#39;s analytic proof of the
infinitude of primes, based on the fact that
&amp;zeta;(&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) has a pole at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; =
1. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt; Linear recurrences with constant coefficients are an
interesting class of recurrence equations that can be solved
explicitly. The most famous example are certainly the Fibonacci
numbers with the equation &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) =
&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-1) +
&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; - 2) and the quite
non-obvious closed form
(&lt;i&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
-
(-&lt;i&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)
/ &amp;radic;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:
overline&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; where &amp;phi; is the golden ratio.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In this work, I build on existing tools in
Isabelle &amp;ndash; such as formal power series and polynomial
factorisation algorithms &amp;ndash; to develop a theory of these
recurrences and derive a fully executable solver for them that can be
exported to programming languages like Haskell. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

This entry is a formalisation of much of Chapters 2, 3, and 11 of
Apostol&#39;s &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Analytic Number
Theory&amp;rdquo;. This includes: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Definitions and
basic properties for several number-theoretic functions (Euler&#39;s
&amp;phi;, M&amp;ouml;bius &amp;mu;, Liouville&#39;s &amp;lambda;,
the divisor function &amp;sigma;, von Mangoldt&#39;s
&amp;Lambda;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Executable code for most of these
functions, the most efficient implementations using the factoring
algorithm by Thiemann &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirichlet products and formal Dirichlet series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytic results connecting convergent formal Dirichlet
series to complex functions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Euler product
expansions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Asymptotic estimates of
number-theoretic functions including the density of squarefree
integers and the average number of divisors of a natural
number&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; These results are useful as a basis for
developing more number-theoretic results, such as the Prime Number
Theorem.</description>

Computers may help us to understand --not just verify-- philosophical
arguments. By utilizing modern proof assistants in an iterative
interpretive process, we can reconstruct and assess an argument by
fully formal means. Through the mechanization of a variant of St.
Anselm&#39;s ontological argument by E. J. Lowe, which is a
paradigmatic example of a natural-language argument with strong ties
to metaphysics and religion, we offer an ideal showcase for our
computer-assisted interpretive method.</description>

&lt;p&gt; We present an embedding of the second-order fragment of the
Theory of Abstract Objects as described in Edward Zalta&#39;s
upcoming work &lt;a
href=&#34;https://mally.stanford.edu/principia.pdf&#34;&gt;Principia
Logico-Metaphysica (PLM)&lt;/a&gt; in the automated reasoning
framework Isabelle/HOL. The Theory of Abstract Objects is a
metaphysical theory that reifies property patterns, as they for
example occur in the abstract reasoning of mathematics, as
&lt;b&gt;abstract objects&lt;/b&gt; and provides an axiomatic
framework that allows to reason about these objects. It thereby serves
as a fundamental metaphysical theory that can be used to axiomatize
and describe a wide range of philosophical objects, such as Platonic
forms or Leibniz&#39; concepts, and has the ambition to function as a
foundational theory of mathematics. The target theory of our embedding
as described in chapters 7-9 of PLM employs a modal relational type
theory as logical foundation for which a representation in functional
type theory is &lt;a
href=&#34;https://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/rtt.pdf&#34;&gt;known to
be challenging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nevertheless we arrive
at a functioning representation of the theory in the functional logic
of Isabelle/HOL based on a semantical representation of an Aczel-model
of the theory. Based on this representation we construct an
implementation of the deductive system of PLM which allows to
automatically and interactively find and verify theorems of PLM.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Our work thereby supports the concept of shallow
semantical embeddings of logical systems in HOL as a universal tool
for logical reasoning &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/publications/Universal-Reasoning/1703_09620_pd.pdf&#34;&gt;as
promoted by Christoph Benzm&amp;uuml;ller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The most notable result of the presented work is the
discovery of a previously unknown paradox in the formulation of the
Theory of Abstract Objects. The embedding of the theory in
Isabelle/HOL played a vital part in this discovery. Furthermore it was
possible to immediately offer several options to modify the theory to
guarantee its consistency. Thereby our work could provide a
significant contribution to the development of a proper grounding for
object theory. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Economic activity has always been a fundamental part of society. Due
to modern day politics, economic theory has gained even more influence
on our lives. Thus we want models and theories to be as precise as
possible. This can be achieved using certification with the help of
formal proof technology. Hence we will use Isabelle/HOL to construct
two economic models, that of the the pure exchange economy and a
version of the Arrow-Debreu Model. We will prove that the
&lt;i&gt;First Theorem of Welfare Economics&lt;/i&gt; holds within
both. The theorem is the mathematical formulation of Adam Smith&#39;s
famous &lt;i&gt;invisible hand&lt;/i&gt; and states that a group of
self-interested and rational actors will eventually achieve an
efficient allocation of goods and services.</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Andersson introduced &lt;em&gt;general balanced trees&lt;/em&gt;,
search trees based on the design principle of partial rebuilding:
perform update operations naively until the tree becomes too
unbalanced, at which point a whole subtree is rebalanced.  This article
defines and analyzes a functional version of general balanced trees,
which we call &lt;em&gt;root-balanced trees&lt;/em&gt;. Using a lightweight model
of execution time, amortized logarithmic complexity is verified in
the theorem prover Isabelle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the APLAS 2017 article
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/aplas17.html&#34;&gt;Verified Root-Balanced Trees&lt;/a&gt;
by the same author, which also presents experimental results that show
competitiveness of root-balanced with AVL and red-black trees.

The Orbit-Stabiliser theorem is a basic result in the algebra of
groups that factors the order of a group into the sizes of its orbits
and stabilisers.  We formalize the notion of a group action and the
related concepts of orbits and stabilisers. This allows us to prove
the orbit-stabiliser theorem.  In the second part of this work, we
formalize the tetrahedral group and use the orbit-stabiliser theorem
to prove that there are twelve (orientation-preserving) rotations of
the tetrahedron.</description>

The propositions-as-types correspondence is ordinarily presented as
linking the metatheory of typed λ-calculi and the proof theory of
intuitionistic logic. Griffin observed that this correspondence could
be extended to classical logic through the use of control operators.
This observation set off a flurry of further research, leading to the
development of Parigots λμ-calculus. In this work, we formalise λμ-
calculus in Isabelle/HOL and prove several metatheoretical properties
such as type preservation and progress.</description>

a triangle&#39;s cevian to the lengths of the triangle&#39;s two
sides. Apollonius&#39; Theorem is a specialisation of Stewart&#39;s
theorem, restricting the cevian to be the median. The proof applies
the law of cosines, some basic geometric facts about triangles and
then simply transforms the terms algebraically to yield the
conjectured relation. The formalization in Isabelle can closely follow
the informal proofs described in the Wikipedia articles of those two
theorems.</description>

       <description>
The architecture of a system describes the system&#39;s overall
organization into components and connections between those components.
With the emergence of mobile computing, dynamic architectures have
become increasingly important. In such architectures, components may
appear or disappear, and connections may change over time. In the
following we mechanize a theory of dynamic architectures and verify
the soundness of a corresponding calculus. Therefore, we first
formalize the notion of configuration traces as a model for dynamic
architectures. Then, the behavior of single components is formalized
in terms of behavior traces and an operator is introduced and studied
to extract the behavior of a single component out of a given
configuration trace. Then, behavior trace assertions are introduced as
a temporal specification technique to specify behavior of components.
Reasoning about component behavior in a dynamic context is formalized
in terms of a calculus for dynamic architectures. Finally, the
soundness of the calculus is verified by introducing an alternative
interpretation for behavior trace assertions over configuration traces
and proving the rules of the calculus. Since projection may lead to
finite as well as infinite behavior traces, they are formalized in
terms of coinductive lists. Thus, our theory is based on
Lochbihler&#39;s formalization of coinductive lists. The theory may
be applied to verify properties for dynamic architectures.</description>

We present a semantics for an applied call-by-value lambda-calculus
that is compositional, extensional, and elementary. We present four
different views of the semantics: 1) as a relational (big-step)
semantics that is not operational but instead declarative, 2) as a
denotational semantics that does not use domain theory, 3) as a
non-deterministic interpreter, and 4) as a variant of the intersection
type systems of the Torino group.  We prove that the semantics is
correct by showing that it is sound and complete with respect to
operational semantics on programs and that is sound with respect to
contextual equivalence. We have not yet investigated whether it is
fully abstract. We demonstrate that this approach to semantics is
useful with three case studies. First, we use the semantics to prove
correctness of a compiler optimization that inlines function
application. Second, we adapt the semantics to the polymorphic
lambda-calculus extended with general recursion and prove semantic
type soundness.  Third, we adapt the semantics to the call-by-value
lambda-calculus with mutable references.

The Isabelle/HOLCF-Prelude is a formalization of a large part of
Haskell&#39;s standard prelude in Isabelle/HOLCF. We use it to prove
the correctness of the Eratosthenes&#39; Sieve, in its
self-referential implementation commonly used to showcase
Haskell&#39;s laziness; prove correctness of GHC&#39;s
&#34;fold/build&#34; rule and related rewrite rules; and certify a
number of hints suggested by HLint.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Minkowski&#39;s theorem relates a subset of
&amp;#8477;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, the Lebesgue measure, and the
integer lattice &amp;#8484;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;: It states that
any convex subset of &amp;#8477;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; with volume
greater than 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; contains at least one lattice
point from &amp;#8484;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;\{0}, i.&amp;thinsp;e. a
non-zero point with integer coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A
related theorem which directly implies this is Blichfeldt&#39;s
theorem, which states that any subset of
&amp;#8477;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; with a volume greater than 1
contains two different points whose difference vector has integer
components.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The entry contains a proof of both
theorems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I formalise a Church-style simply-typed
\(\lambda\)-calculus, extended with pairs, a unit value, and
projection functions, and show some metatheory of the calculus, such
as the subject reduction property. Particular attention is paid to the
treatment of names in the calculus. A nominal style of binding is
used, but I use a manual approach over Nominal Isabelle in order to
extract an executable type inference algorithm. More information can
be found in my &lt;a

       <description>
In this work, we focus on the correctness of Conflict-free Replicated
Data Types (CRDTs), a class of algorithm that provides strong eventual
consistency guarantees for replicated data. We develop a modular and
reusable framework for verifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms.
We avoid correctness issues that have dogged previous mechanised
proofs in this area by including a network model in our formalisation,
and proving that our theorems hold in all possible network behaviours.
Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that accurately
reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we
identify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order
relations, which provides a formal definition of strong eventual
consistency. We then obtain the first machine-checked correctness
theorems for three concrete CRDTs: the Replicated Growable Array, the
Observed-Remove Set, and an Increment-Decrement Counter.</description>

We develop Stone-Kleene relation algebras, which expand Stone relation
algebras with a Kleene star operation to describe reachability in
weighted graphs. Many properties of the Kleene star arise as a special
case of a more general theory of iteration based on Conway semirings
extended by simulation axioms. This includes several theorems
representing complex program transformations. We formally prove the
correctness of Conway&#39;s automata-based construction of the Kleene
star of a matrix. We prove numerous results useful for reasoning about
weighted graphs.</description>

We formalize a range of proof systems for classical propositional
logic (sequent calculus, natural deduction, Hilbert systems,
resolution) and prove the most important meta-theoretic results about
semantics and proofs: compactness, soundness, completeness,
translations between proof systems, cut-elimination, interpolation and
model existence.</description>

       <description>
Partial Semigroups are relevant to the foundations of quantum
mechanics and combinatorics as well as to interval and separation
logics. Convolution algebras can be understood either as algebras of
generalised binary modalities over ternary Kripke frames, in
particular over partial semigroups, or as algebras of quantale-valued
functions which are equipped with a convolution-style operation of
multiplication that is parametrised by a ternary relation. Convolution
algebras provide algebraic semantics for various substructural logics,
including categorial, relevance and linear logics, for separation
logic and for interval logics; they cover quantitative and qualitative
applications. These mathematical components for partial semigroups and
convolution algebras provide uniform foundations from which models of
computation based on relations, program traces or pomsets, and
verification components for separation or interval temporal logics can
be built with little effort.</description>
