This entry contains a formalization of hidden Markov models [3] based
on Johannes Hölzl&#39;s formalization of discrete time Markov chains
[1]. The basic definitions are provided and the correctness of two
main (dynamic programming) algorithms for hidden Markov models is
proved: the forward algorithm for computing the likelihood of an
observed sequence, and the Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most
probable hidden state sequence. The Viterbi algorithm is made
executable including memoization.  Hidden markov models have various
applications in natural language processing. For an introduction see
Jurafsky and Martin [2].</description>

We present a formalization of probabilistic timed automata (PTA) for
which we try to follow the formula MDP + TA = PTA as far as possible:
our work starts from our existing formalizations of Markov decision
processes (MDP) and timed automata (TA) and combines them modularly.
We prove the fundamental result for probabilistic timed automata: the
region construction that is known from timed automata carries over to
the probabilistic setting. In particular, this allows us to prove that
minimum and maximum reachability probabilities can be computed via a
reduction to MDP model checking, including the case where one wants to
disregard unrealizable behavior. Further information can be found in
our ITP paper [2].</description>

This document provides a concise overview on the core results of our
previous work on the exploration of axioms systems for category
theory. Extending the previous studies
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493) we include one further axiomatic
theory in our experiments. This additional theory has been suggested
by Mac Lane in 1948. We show that the axioms proposed by Mac Lane are
equivalent to the ones we studied before, which includes an axioms set
suggested by Scott in the 1970s and another axioms set proposed by
Freyd and Scedrov in 1990, which we slightly modified to remedy a
minor technical issue.</description>

We present a lightweight framework for the automatic verified
(functional or imperative) memoization of recursive functions. Our
tool can turn a pure Isabelle/HOL function definition into a
monadified version in a state monad or the Imperative HOL heap monad,
and prove a correspondence theorem. We provide a variety of memory
implementations for the two types of monads. A number of simple
techniques allow us to achieve bottom-up computation and
space-efficient memoization. The framework’s utility is demonstrated
on a number of representative dynamic programming problems. A detailed
description of our work can be found in the accompanying paper [2].</description>

       <description>
We introduce OpSets, an executable framework for specifying and
reasoning about the semantics of replicated datatypes that provide
eventual consistency in a distributed system, and for mechanically
verifying algorithms that implement these datatypes. Our approach is
simple but expressive, allowing us to succinctly specify a variety of
abstract datatypes, including maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees,
and registers. Our datatypes are also composable, enabling the
construction of complex data structures. To demonstrate the utility of
OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an important
correctness property for collaborative text editing that has
traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this
property can exhibit awkward interleaving of text. We use OpSets to
specify this correctness property and prove that although one existing
replication algorithm satisfies this property, several other published
algorithms do not.</description>

The &#34;Modular Assembly Kit for Security Properties&#34; (MAKS) is
a framework for both the definition and verification of possibilistic
information-flow security properties at the specification-level. MAKS
supports the uniform representation of a wide range of possibilistic
information-flow properties and provides support for the verification
of such properties via unwinding results and compositionality results.
We provide a formalization of this framework in Isabelle/HOL.</description>

       <description>
Bounded natural functors (BNFs) provide a modular framework for the
construction of (co)datatypes in higher-order logic.  Their functorial
operations, the mapper and relator, are restricted to a subset of the
parameters, namely those where recursion can take place.  For certain
applications, such as free theorems, data refinement, quotients, and
generalised rewriting, it is desirable that these operations do not
ignore the other parameters.  In this article, we formalise the
generalisation BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; that extends the mapper
and relator to covariant and contravariant parameters.  We show that
&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s are closed under
functor composition and least and greatest fixpoints,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; subtypes inherit the BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; structure
under conditions that generalise those for the BNF case,
and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s preserve
quotients under mild conditions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; These proofs
are carried out for abstract BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s similar to
the AFP entry BNF Operations.  In addition, we apply the
BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; theory to several concrete functors.</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt;This formalisation contains the proof that there is no
anonymous Social Choice Function for at least three agents and
alternatives that fulfils both Pareto-Efficiency and
Fishburn-Strategyproofness. It was derived from a proof of &lt;a
href=&#34;http://dss.in.tum.de/files/brandt-research/stratset.pdf&#34;&gt;Brandt
&lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on an unverified
translation of a fixed finite instance of the original problem to SAT.
This Isabelle proof contains a machine-checked version of both the
statement for exactly three agents and alternatives and the lifting to
the general case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

and Yamamoto&lt;/a&gt; who proved that all parameters in a certain
range are valid, i.e. guarantee that insertion and deletion preserve
weight-balance. Instead of a general theorem we provide parameterized

       <description>
The following document formalizes and verifies several architectural
design patterns. Each pattern specification is formalized in terms of
a locale where the locale assumptions correspond to the assumptions
which a pattern poses on an architecture. Thus, pattern specifications
may build on top of each other by interpreting the corresponding
locale. A pattern is verified using the framework provided by the AFP
entry Dynamic Architectures. Currently, the document consists of
formalizations of 4 different patterns: the singleton, the publisher
subscriber, the blackboard pattern, and the blockchain pattern.
Thereby, the publisher component of the publisher subscriber pattern
is modeled as an instance of the singleton pattern and the blackboard
pattern is modeled as an instance of the publisher subscriber pattern.
In general, this entry provides the first steps towards an overall
theory of architectural design patterns.</description>

We study three different Hoare logics for reasoning about time bounds
of imperative programs and formalize them in Isabelle/HOL: a classical
Hoare like logic due to Nielson, a logic with potentials due to
Carbonneaux &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;separation
logic&lt;/i&gt; following work by Atkey, Chaguérand and Pottier.
These logics are formally shown to be sound and complete. Verification
condition generators are developed and are shown sound and complete
too.  We also consider variants of the systems where we abstract from
multiplicative constants in the running time bounds, thus supporting a
big-O style of reasoning.  Finally we compare the expressive power of
the three systems.</description>

&lt;p&gt; A Treap is a binary tree whose nodes contain pairs
consisting of some payload and an associated priority. It must have
the search-tree property w.r.t. the payloads and the heap property
w.r.t. the priorities. Treaps are an interesting data structure that
is related to binary search trees (BSTs) in the following way: if one
forgets all the priorities of a treap, the resulting BST is exactly
the same as if one had inserted the elements into an empty BST in
order of ascending priority. This means that a treap behaves like a
BST where we can pretend the elements were inserted in a different
order from the one in which they were actually inserted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In particular, by choosing these priorities at random upon
insertion of an element, we can pretend that we inserted the elements
in &lt;em&gt;random order&lt;/em&gt;, so that the shape of the
resulting tree is that of a random BST no matter in what order we
insert the elements. This is the main result of this
formalisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <description>
Short vectors in lattices and factors of integer polynomials are
related. Each factor of an integer polynomial belongs to a certain
lattice. When factoring polynomials, the condition that we are looking
for an irreducible polynomial means that we must look for a small
element in a lattice, which can be done by a basis reduction
algorithm. In this development we formalize this connection and
thereby one main application of the LLL basis reduction algorithm: an
algorithm to factor square-free integer polynomials which runs in
polynomial time. The work is based on our previous
Berlekamp–Zassenhaus development, where the exponential reconstruction
phase has been replaced by the polynomial-time basis reduction
algorithm. Thanks to this formalization we found a serious flaw in a
textbook.</description>

The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász basis reduction algorithm, also known as
LLL algorithm, is an algorithm to find a basis with short, nearly
orthogonal vectors of an integer lattice. Thereby, it can also be seen
as an approximation to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP), which
is an NP-hard problem, where the approximation quality solely depends
on the dimension of the lattice, but not the lattice itself. The
algorithm also possesses many applications in diverse fields of
computer science, from cryptanalysis to number theory, but it is
specially well-known since it was used to implement the first
polynomial-time algorithm to factor polynomials. In this work we
present the first mechanized soundness proof of the LLL algorithm to
compute short vectors in lattices. The formalization follows a
textbook by von zur Gathen and Gerhard.</description>

We formalise a statement of Green’s theorem—the first formalisation to
our knowledge—in Isabelle/HOL. The theorem statement that we formalise
is enough for most applications, especially in physics and
engineering. Our formalisation is made possible by a novel proof that
avoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument. This
eliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries
explicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.
Instead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between
paths.</description>

We present a formally verified implementation of multivariate Taylor
models. Taylor models are a form of rigorous polynomial approximation,
consisting of an approximation polynomial based on Taylor expansions,
combined with a rigorous bound on the approximation error. Taylor
models were introduced as a tool to mitigate the dependency problem of
interval arithmetic. Our implementation automatically computes Taylor
models for the class of elementary functions, expressed by composition
of arithmetic operations and basic functions like exp, sin, or square
root.</description>

This entry shows that the falling factorial of a sum can be computed
with an expression using binomial coefficients and the falling
factorial of its summands. The entry provides three different proofs:
a combinatorial proof, an induction proof and an algebraic proof using
the Vandermonde identity.  The three formalizations try to follow
their informal presentations from a Mathematics Stack Exchange page as
close as possible. The induction and algebraic formalization end up to
be very close to their informal presentation, whereas the
combinatorial proof first requires the introduction of list
interleavings, and significant more detail than its informal
presentation.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This entry provides an executable functional implementation
of the Median-of-Medians algorithm for selecting the
&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-th smallest element of an unsorted list
deterministically in linear time. The size bounds for the recursive
call that lead to the linear upper bound on the run-time of the
algorithm are also proven. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This article provides a formalisation of Snyder’s simple and
elegant proof of the Mason&amp;ndash;Stothers theorem, which is the
polynomial analogue of the famous abc Conjecture for integers.
Remarkably, Snyder found this very elegant proof when he was still a
high-school student.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, the statement of the
theorem is that three non-zero coprime polynomials
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;
over a field which sum to 0 and do not all have vanishing derivatives
fulfil max{deg(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;), deg(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;),
deg(&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;)} &lt; deg(rad(&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;))
where the rad(&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;) denotes the
&lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;,
i.&amp;thinsp;e. the product of all unique irreducible factors of
&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This theorem also implies a
kind of polynomial analogue of Fermat’s Last Theorem for polynomials:
except for trivial cases,
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; +
&lt;em&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; +
&lt;em&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0 implies
n&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;2 for coprime polynomials
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;
over a field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <title>The string search algorithm by Knuth, Morris and Pratt</title>

       <description>
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is often used to show that the
problem of finding a string &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; in a text
&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; can be solved deterministically in
&lt;i&gt;O(|s| + |t|)&lt;/i&gt; time. We use the Isabelle
Refinement Framework to formulate and verify the algorithm. Via
refinement, we apply some optimisations and finally use the
&lt;em&gt;Sepref&lt;/em&gt; tool to obtain executable code in
&lt;em&gt;Imperative/HOL&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

Stochastic matrices are a convenient way to model discrete-time and
finite state Markov chains. The Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem
tells us something about the existence and uniqueness of non-negative
eigenvectors of a stochastic matrix.  In this entry, we formalize
stochastic matrices, link the formalization to the existing AFP-entry
on Markov chains, and apply the Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem to
prove that stationary distributions always exist, and they are unique
if the stochastic matrix is irreducible.</description>

We provide our Isabelle/HOL formalization of a Conflict-free
Replicated Datatype for Internet Message Access Protocol commands.
We show that Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) is guaranteed
by proving the commutativity of concurrent operations. We base our
formalization on the recently proposed &#34;framework for
establishing Strong Eventual Consistency for Conflict-free Replicated
Datatypes&#34; (AFP.CRDT) from Gomes et al. Hence, we provide an
additional example of how the recently proposed framework can be used
to design and prove CRDTs.</description>

We present a semantic embedding of a spatio-temporal multi-modal
logic, specifically defined to reason about motorway traffic, into
Isabelle/HOL. The semantic model is an abstraction of a motorway,
emphasising local spatial properties, and parameterised by the types
of sensors deployed in the vehicles. We use the logic to define
controller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the absence of
collisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive
definition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to
amend the controller constraints to still guarantee safety.</description>

We discuss a topological curiosity discovered by Kuratowski (1922):
the fact that the number of distinct operators on a topological space
generated by compositions of closure and complement never exceeds 14,
and is exactly 14 in the case of R. In addition, we prove a theorem
due to Chagrov (1982) that classifies topological spaces according to
the number of such operators they support.</description>

This entry provides a very abstract theory of transition systems that
can be instantiated to express various types of automata. A transition
system is typically instantiated by providing a set of initial states,
a predicate for enabled transitions, and a transition execution
function. From this, it defines the concepts of finite and infinite
paths as well as the set of reachable states, among other things. Many
useful theorems, from basic path manipulation rules to coinduction and
run construction rules, are proven in this abstract transition system
context. The library comes with instantiations for DFAs, NFAs, and
Büchi automata.</description>
