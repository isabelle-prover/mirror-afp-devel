<h2>Maintaining an Entry in the AFP</h2>

To maintain an entry, you must have write access to the mercurial repository
of the archive at Bitbucket. To get access, <a
href="https://bitbucket.org">sign up at
Bitbucket</a>, and ask one of the <a
href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/about.shtml#editors">editors</a> to add you
to the AFP project.

<p>
<b>Setup:</b><br>
Check out the archive from the mercurial repository with:

<pre>hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel</pre>

The command above will create a directory <code>afp-devel</code> 
 where theories and additional files are located. You can register
 an ssh key for your account at Bitbucket under "Manage Account/SSH keys" 
 from the avatar icon on the top right of the Bitbucket interface.
</p>

<p>
<b>Maintenance:</b><br>
Maintaining an entry means making sure that this entry 
works with the current Isabelle development version.
Maintainers are not supposed to check in and push new entries. 
New entries must be reviewed and formally accepted. 
They are created on the release branch by the editors.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the type of the entry, you might want to 
work in close lock step with Isabelle development, i.e. 
fix the entry immediately each time it breaks, or loosely, 
i.e. only shortly before a new Isabelle release. The former
is useful for libraries and base entries that are used by 
others, the latter is Ok for larger developments and 
leaf entries. 
</p>
<p>
Small changes might be done by the Isabelle development team for 
you as the change is introduced to Isabelle (don't be surprised 
when your entry changes slightly over time). You will be notified 
when an Isabelle release nears and your entry is broken. 
You can also choose to receive an automatic email notification 
each time your entry breaks (see below).
</p>
<p>
<b>Technicalities:</b>
<ul>
<li>To get the current Isabelle development version, use
<pre>
hg clone http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle 
</pre>
to clone the hg repository. See the README file inside for further instructions.
</li> 
<li>Set up your AFP repository as a component by adding
	<code>init_component "/path_to/afp-devel"</code>
	to your <code>~/.isabelle/etc/settings</code> (or use any other of the
	component adding mechanisms).
	You need this to get access to the AFP settings
	and the <code>afp_build</code> tool.
</li>
<li>To check if entry <code>x</code> works, execute 
    <code>isabelle afp_build x</code>. This assumes that 
    the command <code>isabelle</code> would start 
    up the current Isabelle development version.</li>
<li>To test all entries,
    run <code>isabelle afp_build -A</code>. 
    (Running the script with <code>-?</code> will 
    show options and usage information)</li>
<li>The changes you make to the mercurial repository will 
    not show up on the AFP web pages immediately. 
    This only happens 
    when a new version of the archive is released 
    (usually together with Isabelle). Please contact 
    one of the editors if you feel there is something 
    that should be made available immediately.
    The changes will show up with about 24h delay in the
    web development snapshot of the AFP.</li>
<li>If you make a change that is more than maintenance and
    that you think may be interesting to users of your entry,
    please add a manual change log in the
    file <code>afp-devel/metadata/metada</code> by adding
    an <code>[extra-history]</code> section to your entry.
    If possible and sensible, this log should link to the
    relevant hg change set(s). See existing change logs like
    the one for JinjaThreads for examples.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Email Notification:</b><br>
You can receive an automatic email notification if entry <code>x</code> 
breaks by editing the file <code>afp-devel/thys/x/config</code>:
<ul>
<li>To switch on: add your email address to <code>NOTIFY</code>, hg commit, and hg push the file.
    <code>NOTIFY</code> is a space separated list. If the entry 
    is marked as <code>FREQUENT</code>, the test will run daily.</li>
<li>To switch off: remove your email address from <code>NOTIFY</code> and hg commit + push the file.</li>
</ul>
You can also choose to receive email when the status of any entry in 
AFP changes. This is controlled by <code>MAIN-NOTIFY</code> 
in <code>afp-devel/admin/main-config</code>.
