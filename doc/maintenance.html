<h2>Maintaining an Entry in the AFP</h2>

To maintain an entry, you must have CVS access to the archive at sourceforge. To 
get access, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">register with sourceforge</a>, and ask one of the 
<a href="http://afp.sourceforge.net/about.shtml#editors">editors</a> to add you to 
the AFP project.

<p>
<b>Setup:</b><br>
Check out the archive from the CVS repository with:

<pre>cvs -d &lt;login&gt;@afp.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/afp co -d afp-devel .</pre>

where <code>&lt;login&gt;</code> is your sourceforge login. CVS at
sourceforge assumes that <code>CVS_RSH=ssh</code> and <code>CVS_SERVER</code>
 is unset. The command above will create a directory <code>afp-devel</code> 
 where theories and additional files are located.
More documentation about CVS at sourceforge is available
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=101909">here
[afp]</a> and <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1">here
[ssh keys]</a>.
</p>

<b>Maintenance:</b><br>
Maintaining an entry means making sure that this entry 
works with the current Isabelle development version.
Maintainers are not supposed to check in new entries. 
New entries must be reviewed and formally accepted. 
They are created on the release branch by the editors.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the type of the entry, you might want to 
work in close lock step with Isabelle development, i.e. 
fix the entry immediately each time it breaks, or loosely, 
i.e. only shortly before a new Isabelle release. The former
is useful for libraries and base entries that are used by 
others, the latter is Ok for larger developments and 
leaf entries. 
</p>
<p>
Small changes might be done by the Isabelle development team for 
you as the change is introduced to Isabelle (don't be surprised 
when your entry changes slightly over time). You will be notified 
when an Isabelle release nears and your entry is broken. 
You can also choose to receive an automatic email notification 
each time your entry breaks (see below).
</p>
<p>
<b>Technicalities:</b>
<ul>
<li>To get the current Isabelle development version, download 
    and install it from the
    <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/">Isabelle web site</a>.</li>
<li>For experienced users there is anonymous CVS access to the Isabelle sources. Use
<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvsbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/usr/proj/isabelle-repository/archive login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvsbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/usr/proj/isabelle-repository/archive co isabelle
</pre>
to check them out. The directory structure in the Isabelle repository is 
different from the distribution. It is explained in <code>isabelle/Admin/README.repos</code>.
</li> 
<li>To check if entry <code>x</code> works, go 
    to <code>afp-devel/thys/x</code> and execute 
    <code>isatool make</code>. This assumes that 
    the command <code>Isabelle</code> would start 
    up the current Isabelle development version.</li>
<li>To test all entries, or a number of them, 
    run <code>afp-devel/admin/testall</code>. 
    (Running the script with <code>-?</code> will 
    show options and usage information)</li>
<li>The changes you make to the CVS repository will 
    not show up on the AFP web pages immediately. 
    This only happens 
    when a new version of the archive is released 
    (usually together with Isabelle). Please contact 
    one of the editors if you feel there is something 
    that should be made available immediately.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Email Notification:</b><br>
You can receive an automatic email notification if entry <code>x</code> 
breaks by editing the file <code>afp-devel/thys/x/config</code>:
<ul>
<li>To switch on: add your email address to <code>NOTIFY</code> and cvs commit the file.
    <code>NOTIFY</code> is a space separated list. If the entry 
    is marked as <code>FREQUENT</code>, the test will run daily.</li>
<li>To switch off: remove your email address from <code>NOTIFY</code> and cvs commit the file.</li>
</ul>
You can also choose to receive email when the status of any entry in 
AFP changes. This is controlled by <code>MAIN-NOTIFY</code> 
in <code>afp-devel/admin/main-config</code>.
