New Submissions (editors only)
------------------------------

**Mercurial Setup**

As editor you have at least two working copies of the repository:
current release branch and development version.

-   Start by making a directory `~/afp` where the different branches
    will go.
-   To set up the release version, in that directory do (fill in 20XX)

        hg clone ssh://hg@foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-20XX release

-   for development

        hg clone ssh://hg@foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel devel

You need to add each of those to a corresponding Isabelle installation,
as described on the help page. You might need to resolve additional components
by running `isabelle components -a` afterwards.

You might need to set up ssh keys on Heptapod for this to work. This can
be done under "[Settings/SSH Keys][keys]".

New submissions, changes to the web site and to admin scripts go into
afp/release. About once a week, one of the editors should merge afp-release
into afp-devel, ideally making sure after the merge that the entry works in
the devel version, although that sometimes may be too much and be left for
the authors to fix themselves.

Maintenance and changes on existing submissions all occur in afp/devel
and go properly public with the next Isabelle release (they are only
available as (public) development tar.gz's)

**New Submissions**

Everything happens in the release branch `afp/release`.

1.  unpack tar file and move new entry to `afp/release/thys`
2.  make sure there is a `thys/entryname/ROOT` file and add `entryname`
    to `thys/ROOTS`. For the former see the template in
    `thys/Example-Submission/ROOT`. In particular the entry should be in
    chapter AFP, i.e.

            chapter AFP

            session foo = bar +


3. to check, run in `afp/release/thys`

         ../admin/testall -c <name>

     (be sure to have `ISABELLE_RELEASES` set to the path where Isabelle
    releases are kept, e.g. `/home/proj/isabelle/`)
4. check license headers: if the authors want the code released under
    LGPL instead of BSD, each file should mention "License: LGPL" in the
    header. We only accept the BSD 3-Clause and LPGPL version 2.1 licenses
    as they are printed in `thys/LICENSE` and `thys/LICENSE.LGPL`.
5. `hg add` and `hg commit` the new submission
6. Apply the metadata patch for author/abstract/index/etc with `patch -p0 < PATCH_FILE`
   (from the AFP base directory). When editing the metadata, make sure that your editor
   uses UTF-8 encoding to preserve special characters.
7. Generate the new web site by running `../admin/sitegen` .
8. Use `hg st` and `hg diff` to make sure the generated html makes
    sense. The diff should be small and concern the new entry only.
9. `hg add` and `hg commit` the web site updates.
10. finally, when you are happy with everything, `hg push` all changes
    to Heptapod. The publish script will refuse to publish if the
    changes aren't pushed.
11. to publish the changes to the web, run (with **all sessions** of the entry)

         ../admin/publish <sessions...>

    This will check out the Isabelle202X (=release) version of the
    archive from Heptapod, run the specified sessions (all sessions of the
    new entry, space-separated) to generate HTML, produce a `.tar.gz` for the
    archive and for the entry, and update the web pages on the server. The
    script will ask before it copies, so you can check locally if everything is
    as you want it.

12. That's it. Changes should show up at <http://isa-afp.org>

**New submission in devel**

Although it is a condition of submission that the entry works with the
current stable Isabelle version, occasionally it happens that a
submission does not work with the stable version and cannot be
backported, but is important/good enough to include anyway. In this
case, we can't release the submission on the main web site yet, but we
can add it to the development version of the archive, such that it is at
least available to those who are working with the current Isabelle
development snapshot.

The check-in procedure is the same as for a normal release entry, apart
from the fact that everything happens in the devel instead of release
directory and that the last step (publish) is omitted.
If the submission does not work with the stable version, there is also no
lint report. With the [linter installed](https://github.com/isabelle-prover/isabelle-linter#installation)),
it can be generated via:
```
isabelle lint -d '$AFP' -o lint_bundles=afp_mandatory <sessions>
```

The authors of the entry should be notified that the entry will only
show up on the front page when the next Isabelle version is released.

**Handling submissions**

New submissions are automatically announced by email to all
editors. If you would like to handle a submission, simply reply to
[afp-submit] (= all editors) and say so (e.g. "I'll take it"). At the
same time update the global list of all submissions at
<https://www.isa-afp.org/webapp/submissions> by toggling the field
behind the submission to "Review" (and pressing "update" every time you
toggle this field). If a submission is rejected (either because it
needs to be improved or terminally), toggle the field to "Rejected".
Once you have added a submission, toggle the field to "Added".

When reviewing a submission there are two criteria: form and
contents.

*Form* The AFP should not contain brittle proofs that are hard to
maintain. In particular, submissions should conform to the submission
guidelines on our Submission page.  The AFP submission system runs a
special linter that flags (certain kinds of) potentially brittle
proofs. For example, the linter will complain about *_tac proof
methods because they can refer to system-generated names, a definite
no-no!. The linter report is listed at the end of the submission
run. It is up to the editor to decide if and how much the authors
should revise their proofs. Editors may also find proofs
objectionable for reasons not covered by the linter. In the end, the
handling editor has to decide how much time they want to spend
reviewing a submission ...

Something else that is often missing: literature references. Where do
the proofs come from (if the authors did not invent them)?

*Contents* We rarely reject submissions because of the
contents, but it does happen. Possible reasons: triviality and duplication.

If in doubt, submissions can be discussed on the mailing list [afp-submit].
