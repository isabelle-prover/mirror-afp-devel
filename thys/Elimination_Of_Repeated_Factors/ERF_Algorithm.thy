  An executable algorithm to split a polynomial over a perfect field
  into a product of pairwise coprime, squarefree (but not necessarily irreducible)
  polynomials.

  This is useful as a preprocessing stage for full factoring algorithms,
  which typically assume the input to be squarefree.

  It can also be used to compute the radical of a polynomial, i.e. the
  product of its prime factors.

  Note that, most notably, perfect fields cover both fields of characteristic 0
  (where the algorithm is trivial) and finite fields (i.e. Galois fields).

section \<open>Elimination of Repeated Factors Algorithm\<close>

text \<open>This file contains the elimnation of repeated factors (ERF) algorithm for polynomials over 
perfect fields.
This algorithm does not only work over fields with characteristic $0$ like the classical Yun Algorithm
but also for example over finite fields with prime characteristic (i.e.\ $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ for $q=p^n$, 
$n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $p$ prime). 
Intuitively, the ERF algorithm proceeds similarly to the classical Yun algorithm, taking the gcd 
of the polynomial and its derivative and thus eliminating repeated factors iteratively.
However, if we work over finite characteristic, prime factors with exponent divisible by the 
characteristic $p$ are cancelled out since $p\equiv 0$.
Therefore, we separate prime factors with exponent divisible by the characteristic from the rest
and treat them seperately in the ERF algorithm.\<close>

text \<open>The funtion \<open>ERF_step\<close> describes the main body of the ERF algorithm. 
Let us walk through the algorithm step by step. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A polynomial of degree $0$ is constant and thus there is nothing to do.
\item We only consider the monic part of our polynomial $f$ using the \<^const>\<open>normalize\<close> function.
\item $u$ is the gcd of the monic $f$ and its derivative. 
\item $u=1$ iff $f$ is already square-free. If the characteristic is zero, this property is already 
fulfilled. Otherwise we continue and denote the (prime) characteristic by $p$. 
\item If $u\neq 1$, we split $f$ in a part $v$ and $w$. $v$ is already square-free and contains all
prime factors with exponent not divisible by $p$.
\item $w$ contains all prime factors with exponent divisible by $p$. Thus we can take the $p$-th 
root of $w$ (by using the inverse Frobenius homomorphism \<^const>\<open>inv_frob_poly\<close>) 
and obtain $z$ (which we will further reduce in an iterative step).
\end{itemize}\<close>
