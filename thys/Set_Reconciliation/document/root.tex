\title{A Set Reconciliation Algorithm}
\author{Paul Hofmeier and Emin Karayel}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This entry formally verifies the set reconciliation algorithm with nearly optimal communication
complexity, due to Y.~Minsky \emph{et~al.}\ \cite{minsky}.
The algorithm allows two communication partners, who have a similar pair of sets to reconcile them
while using messages of nearly optimal size, proportional to a bound on the maximum symmetric
difference between the sets. 

The formalization also introduces an optimization, which reduces the communication complexity even
further compared to the original publication.
