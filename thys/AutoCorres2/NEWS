AutoCorres / C-Parser NEWS -- history of user-relevant changes
==============================================================

(Note: Isabelle/jEdit shows a tree-view of the NEWS file in Sidekick.)

New in Repository Version
-------------------------

*** AutoCorres ***
* Replaced former ('s, 'a) nondet_monad by more canonical
  ('e::default, 'a, 's) spec_monad with instances 
  ('a, 's) res_monad, for calculations without exceptions and
  ('e, 'a, 's) exn_monad, for calculations with exceptions.

* Union suppprt:
  - Single variant unions
  - Multi variant unions for packed variants with the same size
  c.f.: autocorres/tests/proof-tests/union_ac.thy

* Support for pointers to local variables. When an address of a local
  variable is used the variable is allocated 
  on the heap. c.f.:
  autocorres/tests/proof-tests/pointes_to_locals.thy.

* Support for abstraction of pointer parameters to in-out parameters.
  This might allow to completely get rid of pointers to local variables
  and replace them by value passing functions. c.f:
  autocorres/tests/proof-tests/in_out_parameters.thy.

* Extension of heap lifting to support pointers into structures and
  thus sharing of sub-structures. Removed the limitation to
  packed_types. c.f.:
  autocorres/tests/proof-tests/open_struct.thy.

* Optimized flow analysis to reduce meaningless arguments in tuples
  (e.g. while loops) and meaningless initialisation of variables (e.g.
  return variables). This analysis happens during the local-variable
  extraction phase (L2) after introducing nested error-types
  (c.f. section on exit below).
 
* Support for 'wellbehaved' goto statements, i.e. gotos that jump
  forward or out of a block (like exceptions) but not inside a block 
  or backwards.

    Supported:
     
      {
        ... 
        goto l;
        ...
      }
      l: ...
      
              ---------------
      ...
      goto l
      ...
      l: ...


    Not supported:

      { ... 
        l: ...
      }
      goto l;
             
              ---------------

     l: ...
     ...
     goto l;
   
  
* Added support of C-exit function 'void exit(int)', which exits the
  program with an exit status, aka. global termination with status.
  INCOMPATIBILITY: the C-Parser as well as autocorres faithfully
  propagte the exit value accross procedure boundaries. In SIMPL the
  exit status is stored within 'global_exn_var' within the new
  variant 'Global status' of 'c_exntype'. After autocorres the
  status will be returned in the error monad result 'Inl status'.
  We introduce a uniform treatment of abrupt termination 
  (Break, Continue, Return and exit) as nested sum-type in the error-monad 
  (c.f. monadic functions "try" and "finally"). The nesting level of the 
  sum-type, reflects the static nesting of the try, resp. finally blocks.
  Programs that do not use "exit" at all will still reside in the "nondet" 
  monad as before, however their shape might be slightly changed due to 
  the nested sum-type for exceptions instead to the single 
  layer sum-type before. e.g.
   
    int foo() {
      ...
      while (1) {
        ...
        break; // results in "Inl (Inr ())" which is handled by a try or
               // finally around the while
        ...
        return 1; // results in "Inl (Inl (Inr 1))" which is handled
                  // by a try of finally around the procedure body
      }
    }


* Removed option "force_heap_abs". Heap abstraction (split heap) is
  always tried. Functions can explicitly be excluded by option 
  "no_heap_abs".

* added option unfold_constructor_bind (Selectors | Always | Never) to
  give some user level control to unfold certain "simple" binds.
  Default is Selectors, cf.:
  autocorres/tests/proof-tests/unfold_bind_options.thy.

* added command final-autocorres to create locales
  <filename>_all_impl and <filename>_all_corres albeit not all
  functions are processed yet.

* (Mutually) recursive functions are now implemented without an
  explicit measure parameter but constructed as a CCPO fixpoint 
  (command: fixed_point)

* Support for function-pointers (with parameters):
    * Constant function pointer parameters
    * Dispatching of function pointers via global static variable.
      (e.g. array of class like structs), including indirect 
      (mutual) recursion through these function pointers.
    * C-style objects (structs) with pointer parameter fields
  Examples: autocorres/tests/proof-tests/fnptr.thy
  Limitations: 
    * higher-order function pointer parameters unsupported, meaning
      the function pointer parameter itself may not have another 
      funtion pointer parameter. (This is not a conceptual limitation 
      but merely a result of the current implementation avoiding
      to deal with nested correspondence assumptions).

* Refined tracing / profiling via various options: 
    verbose_timing / verbose_timing_threshold 
    verbose / verbose_indent
    autocorres_profile_conversion_enbaled /
    autocorres_profile_conversion_verbosity
  cf. tests/proof-tests/profile_conversion.thy 
      tests/examples/TraceDemo.thy

  Discontinued autocorres_options: trace_heap_lift / trace_word_abs
      

* Discontinued option "c_locale" to define a custom locale, as the
  locale setup is now much more involved due to the switch to
  the statespace representation of local variables.

* Added option "preservation_cache_mode" to experiment with different
  caching strategies for the variable preservation proofs in the
  L2 phase. These preservation proofs are interweaved with the 
  process of introducing lambda abstractions for local variables and
  the correspondence proofs.

   -1: Disable caching
    0: Basic caching (default). The cache is indexed by two stages,
       first the L1-terms and then by the list
       of variables that are preserved by executing the term.
       Theorems are built buttom up following the L1-term structure,
       * first proving preservation of a single variable 
         for each atomic statement in the leaves
       * then combining these theorems for the set of
         variables that should be preserved
       * then propagating these results to compound statements.
    1: Derive the preservation theorem from an already existing 
       theorem for a superset of variables (instead of building it
       from scratch)
    2: Combine existing theorems to form preservation of
       a superset of variables before doing the step as in mode = 1.
    

 
* Renovated parallel processing of functions in C-File. By default
  tasks are split on a function as well as autocorres-phase basis.
  Call-graph as well as autocorres-phase dependencies are respected:
 
  - Removed command option "generate_theories"
  - added option "single_threaded" to disable parallel processing.

* More fine grained control of optimisation options. Removed option
"no_opt". Introduced options:
  do_polish = false | true (default), for final polishing phase
  L1_opt = RAW | PEEP (default)
  L2_opt = RAW | PEEP (default)
  HL_opt = RAW | PEEP (default)
  WA_opt = RAW | PEEP (default) 

* Added some profiling for autocorres conversions. Options

  autocorres_profile_conversion_enabled = true | false (default)
  autocorres_profile_conversion_verbosity = 0 (default) | 1 

* Added configuration option autocorres_timing_threshold (default 3)
  Specifies the threshold (in milliseconds) for which timing output
  shall be preduced (in addition to level specified in autocorres_timing).

* New option "phase" to specify up to which phase (L1, L2, HL, WA, TS)
autocorres will process the functions. This allows incremental
processing of phases.

* New command "init-autocorres" to initialise autocorres for a C-file
in order to process it in multiple subsequent theories in parallel. 
The theory with the init-autocorres is the base theory for subsequent 
autocorres invocations. The theory files should be organized respecting
the call-graph dependencies. By specifying "scope" and "phase" accordingly 
processing can be split into multiple theories for better utilization 
of CPU cores. Instead, when processing all functions and phases within a single 
autocorres-command, evaluation is basically linearized due to the 
linear nature of the definition stages in each phase. 

  Command option "generate_theories" will generate theories reflecting
incremental processing of the call-graph and the phases to utilize
maximal parallel execution. The final theory that combines all results
is named "autocorres_final_<name of c file without suffix>.thy".

  By default files will be generated in the same directory as the theory 
that invoces the command. This directory can be extended by specifying
command option "generate_theories_path = <subdirectory>".

* Configuration option "verbose" (default 0), for some 
more verbose tracing. Larger numbers mean more information.

*** C-Parser ***

* Support compiler directives 
    - typeof(<expr>)
    - offsetof(<type>, <field-name>)
  cf. ex.c / CTranslationInfrastructure.thy

* Support aligned attribute:
    __attribute__ ((aligned(<expr>)))
  cf. testfiles/aligned.thy

* Avoid anonymous structure / union names within typedefs by using
  the typedef name.

* Avoid anonymous structure / union names for nested structures / unions
  by using the qualified name derived from the field / variant names.

* Added support for wellbehaved goto statements (see section:
  AutoCorres)
* Added support for C-exit function (see section: AutoCorres).

* New command 'include_C_file'. Files to be included into main c
  file have to be declared. This enables proper treatment of those
  files within Isabelle/jEdit.

     include_C_file <filename> for <main-file>
     ...
     install_C_file <main-file>

* Uniform error reporting for C-files (with PIDE conform positions)
 
* Uniform handling of options after filename (including 'memsafe', 
  'c_types', 'c_defs' which were before the filename).

     install_C_file <filename> <options>

* Feedback reference variable replaced by configuration options: 
   'level': (default 0): 1,2,... will trigger more output
   'verbose': (default false): false = prefer short notifications 
     (e.g. for internal proofs, hints on proof-step but not the 
     actual goal)
  
* new option 'prune_types' (default true) for command install_C_file,
  prunes all unused types, e.g. resulting from unused variants of
  a union declaration.

* Use standard file provider to read C-files. Dependency on C-file is 
tracked, and changes are automatically propagated. 
Caveat: indirect imports (via #include) in C-files are not tracked.
Minor INCOMPATIBILITY: When installing a file via some path like 

  install_C_file "foo/bar.c"

then use only the plain base name in subsequent autocorres:

  autocorres "bar.c" (instead of autocorres "foo/bar.c").

*** General ***

* Command "fixed_point" to define mutual recursive partial functions
  on CCPOs. cf.:
  autocorres/tests/examples/Mutual_Fixed_Points.thy

* Command "lazy_named_theorems" providing collections of theorems
  with a declaration (instead of an attribute) postponing application
  of the morphism. This speeds up entering locales as the optimisations
  for lazy-facts / lazy-notes are only effective for theorems without 
  attributes.

* Changed the representation of local variables in SIMPL from a
  record to a function (from names to values) making use of the
  statespace package. This enabled to implement a uniform calling 
  convention for function pointers with parameters. As statespaces are 
  based on locales, the change resulted in a major refactoring of
  both the C-Parser and AutoCorres to work properly within locales.

* Dependency on MLton is removed. ML-Lex / ML-Yacc are integrated
  into Isabelle/ML.

*** ML ***

* Antiquotation "infer_instantiate" (extending "instantiate") which
  infers type instantiations from term instantiations 
  (like Thm.infer_instantiate).

* Antiquotation "match" to match on cterms, cf.:
  lib/mk-helper/Match_Cterm.thy

* Antiquotation "record" which generates get and map functions for
  the record fields, cf.:
  lib/ML_Record_Antiquotation.thy
