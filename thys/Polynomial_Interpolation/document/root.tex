\title{Polynomial Interpolation\footnote{Supported by FWF (Austrian Science Fund) project Y757.}}

\begin{abstract}
We formalized three algorithms for polynomial interpolation over arbitrary fields: 
Kronecker's explicit expression,
the recursive algorithm of Neville-Aitken, and Newton interpolation in combination with an
efficient implementation of divided differences. All algorithms are also available in a variant
for integer polynomials, where sometimes the interpolation can fail: there obviously is no
integer polynomial $p$ such that $p(0) = 0$ and $p(2) = 1$. Moreover, for
Newton interpolation over the integers we proved that also all intermediate 
results that are computed during the algorithm must be integers. This admits a fast failure in the 
implementation, and theoretically implies that
there is no integer polynomial $p$ at all satisfying $p(0) = 0$ and $p(2) = 1$, regardless
of the degree of the polynomial.

Finally, we proved uniqueness of polynomial interpolation.

\section{Introduction}

All of the algorithms have been taken from Wikipedia.
TODO: find some algebra book where all of the algorithms are described and \cite{it}.

TODO: write some more text, also included side-products, like improved code equations for
division.
