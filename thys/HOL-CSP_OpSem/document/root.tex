\title{HOL-CSP\_OpSem -- Operational Semantics formally proven in HOL-CSP}
\author{Beno√Æt Ballenghien and Burkhart Wolff}
\maketitle
\chapter*{Abstract}

   Recently, a modern version of Roscoe and Brookes \cite{brookes-roscoe85} 
   Failure-Divergence Semantics for CSP has been formalized in Isabelle \cite{HOL-CSP-AFP}
   and extended \cite{HOL-CSPM-AFP}. The resulting framework is purely denotational
   and, given the possibility to define arbitrary events in a HOL-type, more expressive 
   than the original.

   However, there is a need for an operational semantics for CSP. From the latter, model-checkers,
   symbolic execution engines for test-case generators, and animators and simultors can be 
   constructed. In the literature, a few versions of operational semantics
   for CSP have been proposed, where it is assumed, of course, that denotational and operational 
   constructs coincide, but this is not obvious at first glance.Recently, a modern version of Roscoe and Brookes \cite{brookes-roscoe85}

   for CSP have been proposed, where it is assumed, of course, that denotational and operational 
   constructs coincide, but this is not obvious at first glance.
   
   The present work addresses this issue by providing the first (to our knowledge) formal theory 
   of operational behavior derived from HOL-CSP via a bridge definition between the 
   denotational and the operational semantics.
   In fact, the construction is done via locale contexts to be as general as possible,
   and several possibilities are discussed.
   
   As a bonus, we have proven new ```laws'' for HOL-CSP.
