section \<open>Maximal Path Tries\<close>

text \<open>Drastically reduced implementation of tries that consider only maximum length sequences as elements.
      Inserting a sequence that is prefix of some already contained sequence does not alter the trie.
      Intended to store IO-sequences to apply in testing, as in this use-case proper prefixes need not be applied separately.\<close>
