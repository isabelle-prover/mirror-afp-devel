\title{Quasi-Borel Spaces}
\author{Michikazu Hirata, Yasuhiko Minamide, Tetsuya Sato}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The notion of quasi-Borel spaces was introduced by Heunen et al.~\cite{Heunen_2017}.
  The theory provides a suitable denotational model
  for higher-order probabilistic programming languages with continuous distributions.

  This entry is a formalization of the theory of quasi-Borel spaces, including
  construction of quasi-Borel spaces (product, coproduct, function spaces),
  the adjunction between the category of measurable spaces and the category of quasi-Borel spaces,
  and the probability monad on quasi-Borel spaces.
  This entry also contains the formalization of the Bayesian regression presented in the work of Heunen et al.
  
  This work is a part of the work by same authors,
  \textit{Program Logic for Higher-Order Probabilistic Programs in Isabelle/HOL},
  which will be published in proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS 2022).
