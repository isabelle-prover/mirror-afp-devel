abstract="This paper describes Hoare logics for a number of imperative language constructs, from while-loops via exceptions to mutually recursive procedures. Both partial and total correctness are treated. In particular a proof system for total correctness of recursive procedures in the presence of unbounded nondeterminism is presented. All systems are formalized and shown to be sound and complete in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.",

To increase confidence in the formalization, we present two versions: one in Isabelle/HOL and one in Coq. We extend the metatheory to include features used in practice, such as systems of differential equations and functions of multiple arguments. We demonstrate the viability of constructing a verified kernel for the hybrid systems theorem prover KeYmaera X by embedding proof checkers for differential dynamic logic in Coq and Isabelle. We discuss how different provers and libraries influence the design of the formalization.},

  Abstract =	 {Machines powered by artificial intelligence
                  increasingly mediate our social, cultural, economic
                  and political interactions. Understanding the
                  behaviour of artificial intelligence systems is
                  essential to our ability to control their actions,
                  reap their benefits and minimize their harms. Here
                  we argue that this necessitates a broad scientific
                  research agenda to study machine behaviour that
                  incorporates and expands upon the discipline of
                  computer science and includes insights from across
                  the sciences. We first outline a set of questions
                  that are fundamental to this emerging field and then
                  explore the technical, legal and institutional
                  constraints on the study of machine behaviour.},

                  act is only unlawful if the agent conducting the act
                  has a ‘guilty mind’ (‘mens rea’). Different law
                  systems distinguish different modes of mens rea. For
                  instance, American law distinguishes between
                  ‘knowingly’ performing a criminal act,
                  ‘recklessness’, ‘strict liability’, etc. This paper
                  shows we can formalize several of these
                  categories. The formalism used is a complete stit
                  logic featuring operators for actions taking effect
                  in next states, operators for S5-knowledge and
                  operators for SDL-type obligation. The different
                  modes of ‘mens rea’ correspond to the violation
                  conditions of different types of obligation
                  definable in the logic."

                  beginning to operate within society. All
                  participants in society are required to follow
                  specific regulations and laws. An autonomous system
                  cannot be an exception. Inevitably an autonomous
                  system will find itself in a situation in which it
                  needs to not only choose to obey a rule or not, but
                  also make a complex ethical decision. However, there
                  exists no obvious way to implement the human
                  understanding of ethical behaviour in
                  computers. Even if we enable autonomous systems to
                  distinguish between more and less ethical
                  alternatives, how can we be sure that they would
                  choose right? We consider autonomous systems with a
                  hybrid architecture in which the highest level of
                  reasoning is executed by a rational (BDI) agent. For
                  such a system, formal verification has been used
                  successfully to prove that specific rules of
                  behaviour are observed when making decisions. We
                  propose a theoretical framework for ethical plan
                  selection that can be formally verified. We
                  implement a rational agent that incorporates a given
                  ethical policy in its plan selection and show that
                  we can formally verify that the agent chooses to
                  execute, to the best of its beliefs, the most
                  ethical available plan."

                  series introducing logics for reasoning about the
                  dynamics of knowledge and beliefs. Part I introduced
                  different logical systems that can be used to reason
                  about the knowledge and beliefs of a group of
                  agents. In this second paper, I show how to adapt
                  these logical systems to reason about the knowledge
                  and beliefs of a group of agents during the course
                  of a social interaction or rational
                  inquiry. Inference, communication and observation
                  are typical examples of informative events, which
                  have been subjected to a logical analysis. The main
                  goal of this article is to introduce the key
                  conceptual and technical issues that drive much of
                  the research in this area.},

  abstract =	 {The picture of information acquisition as the
                  elimination of possibilities has proven fruitful in
                  many domains, serving as a foundation for formal
                  models in philosophy, linguistics, computer science,
                  and economics. While the picture appears simple, its
                  formalization in dynamic epistemic logic reveals
                  subtleties: given a valid principle of information
                  dynamics in the language of dynamic epistemic logic,
                  substituting complex epistemic sentences for its
                  atomic sentences may result in an invalid
                  principle. In this article, we explore such failures
                  of uniform substitution. First, we give epistemic
                  examples inspired by Moore, Fitch, and
                  Williamson. Second, we answer affirmatively a
                  question posed by van Benthem: can we effectively
                  decide when every substitution instance of a given
                  dynamic epistemic principle is valid? In technical
                  terms, we prove the decidability of this schematic
                  validity problem for public announcement logic (PAL
                  and PAL-RC) over models for finitely many fully
                  introspective agents, as well as models for
                  infinitely many arbitrary agents. The proof of this
                  result illuminates the reasons for the failure of
                  uniform substitution.},
