\title{HOL-CSPM - Architectural operators for HOL-CSP}
\author{Beno√Æt Ballenghien \and Safouan Taha \and Burkhart Wolff}
\maketitle
\chapter*{Abstract}

   Recently, a modern version of Roscoes and Brookes \cite{brookes-roscoe85} 
   Failure-Divergence Semantics for CSP has been formalized in Isabelle \cite{HOL-CSP-AFP}. 
   On top of this theory, we develop the so-called ``architectural operators'', i.e.
   generalizations of basic non-deterministic choices, synchronized producs and sequetializations,
   as has been introduced in the well-known FDR4 model-checker for CSP.

   While FDR4 uses these architectural operators as handy macros that help to structure
   the specifications, they are basically macro-expanded before the Labelled Transition
   Systems were generated. In contrast, we develop the formal theory of these operators
   in themselves which paves the way for a more structured approach to reasoning 
   in HOL-CSP. Our generalizations will take commutativity and idempotence into account,
   such that they become fully-abstract wrt. to index-sets, index-multi-sets or lists, 
   respectively. 

   Additionally, the theory of some more exotic --- but in the CSP literature discussed --- 
   operators have been developed; in particular throw and interupt.

   For these "architectural operators", we will prove the properties of refinement,
   monotonicity and continuity and the laws of interaction in order to simplify their use.

   Finally, we will give examples of their usefulness when trying to model complex systems.
