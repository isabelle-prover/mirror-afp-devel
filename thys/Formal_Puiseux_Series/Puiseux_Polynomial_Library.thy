  Since the required sort constraints are not available inside the class, we have to resort
  to a somewhat awkward way of writing the definition of algebraically closed fields:
\<close>
class alg_closed_field = field +
  assumes alg_closed: "n > 0 \<Longrightarrow> f n \<noteq> 0 \<Longrightarrow> \<exists>x. (\<Sum>k\<le>n. f k * x ^ k) = 0"

text \<open>
  We can then however easily show the equivalence to the proper definition:
\<close>
lemma alg_closed_imp_poly_has_root:
  assumes "degree (p :: 'a :: alg_closed_field poly) > 0"
  shows   "\<exists>x. poly p x = 0"
proof -

  assumes "\<And>p :: 'a poly. degree p > 0 \<Longrightarrow> lead_coeff p = 1 \<Longrightarrow> \<exists>x. poly p x = 0"
  shows   "OFCLASS('a :: field, alg_closed_field_class)"
proof
  fix n :: nat and f :: "nat \<Rightarrow> 'a"
  assume n: "n > 0" "f n \<noteq> 0"
  define p where "p = Abs_poly (\<lambda>k. if k \<le> n then f k else 0)"
  have coeff_p: "coeff p k = (if k \<le> n then f k else 0)" for k
  proof -
    have "eventually (\<lambda>k. k > n) cofinite"
