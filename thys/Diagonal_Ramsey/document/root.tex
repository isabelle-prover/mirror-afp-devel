\title{An Exponential Improvement\\ for Diagonal Ramsey}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

The (diagonal) Ramsey number $R(k)$ denotes the minimum size of a complete graph such that every red-blue colouring of its edges contains a monochromatic subgraph of size $k$.
In 1935, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres found an upper bound, proving that $R(k)\le 4^k$. Somewhat later, a lower bound of $\sqrt{2}^k$ was established.
In subsequent improvements to the upper bound, the base of the exponent stubbornly 
remained at 4 until March 2023, when Campos et al.\ \cite{campos-exponential-ramsey}
sensationally showed that $R(k)\le (4-\epsilon)^k$ for a particular
small positive $\epsilon$.

The Isabelle/HOL formalisation of the result presented here is largely
independent of the prior formalisation (in Lean) by Bhavik Mehta.
