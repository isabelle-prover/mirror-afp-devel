\title{A Mechanically Verified, Efficient, Sound and Complete Theorem Prover For First Order Logic}
\author{Tom Ridge}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Building on work by Wainer and Wallen, formalised by James
  Margetson, we present soundness and completeness proofs for a system
  of first order logic. The completeness proofs naturally suggest an
  algorithm to derive proofs. This algorithm can be implemented in a
  tail recursive manner. We provide the formalisation in Isabelle/HOL\@.
  The algorithm can be executed via the rewriting tactics of Isabelle.
  Alternatively, we transport the definitions to OCaml, to give a
  directly executable program.

\section{Introduction}

Wainer and Wallen gave soundness and completeness proofs for first
order logic in \cite{Wainer:92}. This material was later formalised by
James Margetson \cite{margetson99completeness}. We ported this to the
current version of Isabelle in \cite{margetson04completeness}. Drawing
on some of the proofs in previous versions, especially the proof of
soundness for the $\forall I$ rule, we formalise modified proofs, for
a related system. Implicit in \cite{Wainer:92}, and noted by Margetson
in \cite{margetson99completeness}, is that the proofs of completeness
suggest a constructive algorithm. We derive this algorithm, which
turns out to be tail recursive, and this is the origin of our claim
for efficiency. The algorithm can be executed in Isabelle using the
rewriting engine. Alternatively, we provide an implementation in
Ocaml.

\section{Optimisation and Extension}

There are plenty of obvious optimisations. The first medium level
optimisation is to avoid the recomputation of newvars by incorporating
the maxvar into a sequent. At a low level, most of the list operations
are just moving a pointer along a list: only FConj requires
duplicating a list. Reporting ``not provable'' on obviously non-provable
goals would be useful, as would a more efficient choice of witnessing
terms for existentials.

In terms of extensions, the obvious targets
are function terms and equality.
