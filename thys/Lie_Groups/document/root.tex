\title{Lie Groups and Algebras}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Lie Groups are formalised as locales, building on the theory of Smooth Manifolds \cite{Smooth_Manifolds-AFP}. We formalise the diffeomorphism group of a manifold, and the action of a Lie group on a manifold. The general linear group is shown to be a Lie group by proving properties of the determinant, and matrix inverses.
	We also develop a theory of smooth vector fields on a $C^\infty$ manifold $M$, defined as smooth maps from the manifold to its tangent bundle $TM$. We employ a shortcut that avoids difficulties in defining the tangent bundle as a manifold, but which still leads to vector fields with the properties one would expect. Notably, they are derivations $C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(M)$.
	We construct \emph{the} Lie algebra of a Lie group as an algebra of left-invariant smooth vector fields. Our main reference for the mathematics of smooth manifolds is Lee's textbook \cite{lee2012}, which also contains material on Lie groups and algebras.
