                   automated theorem proving in classical higher-order
                   logic (based on Church's simply typed lambda
                   calculus) and discuss their requirements with respect
                   to Henkin completeness and full extensionality. In
                   particular we focus on Andrews' higher-order
                   resolution [Andrews71], Huet's constrained resolution
                   [Huet72], higher-order $E$-resolution, and
                   extensional higher-order resolution
                   [BenzmuellerKohlhase98]. With the help of examples we
                   illustrate the parallels and differences of the
                   extensionality treatment of these approaches and
                   demonstrate that extensional higher-order resolution
                   is the sole approach that can completely avoid
                   additional extensionality axioms.},
