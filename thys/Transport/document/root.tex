\title{Transport via Partial Galois Connections and Equivalences}
\author{Kevin Kappelmann}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This entry contains the accompanying formalisation of the paper
``Transport via Partial Galois Connections and Equivalences'' (APLAS 2023)~\cite{transport}.
It contains a theoretical framework to transport programs via equivalences,
subsuming the theory of Isabelle's Lifting package~\cite{lifting}.
It also contains a prototype to automate transports using this framework in Isabelle/HOL,\@
but this prototype is not yet ready for production.
Finally, it contains a library on top of Isabelle/HOL's axioms,
including various relativised concepts on orders, functions, binary relations,
and Galois connections and equivalences.
