\section{Introduction}

Signed measures are a generalization of measures that can map measurable sets to negative values. In this work we formalize the Hahn decomposition theorem for signed measures, namely that if $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a measure space for a signed measure $\mu$, then $\Omega$ can be decomposed as $\Omega^+ \cup \Omega^-$, where every measurable subset of $\Omega^+$ has a positive measure, and every measurable subset of $\Omega^-$ has a negative measure. We then prove that this decomposition is essentially unique, meaning that if $X^+ \cup X^-$ is another such decomposition, then any measurable subset in $(\Omega^+\triangle X^+) \cup (\Omega^- \triangle X^-)$ has a zero measure.

We also formalize the Jordan decomposition theorem as a corollary, which states that the signed measure $\mu$ admits a unique decomposition into a difference $\mu = \mu^+ - \mu^-$ of two positive measures, at least one of which is finite, and such that for any Hahn decomposition $\Omega^+ \cup \Omega^-$ and measurable set $A$, if $A\subseteq \Omega^-$ then $\mu^+(A) = 0$ and if $A\subseteq \Omega^+$ then $\mu^-(A) = 0$.
The formalization is mostly based on \cite{benedetto}, Section 16 of Chapter 4.
