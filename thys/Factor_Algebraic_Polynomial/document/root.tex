\title{Factorization of Polynomials with Algebraic Coefficients\footnote{Supported by FWF (Austrian Science Fund) project Y757.}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The AFP already contains a verified implementation of algebraic numbers.
However, it is has a severe limitation in its 
factorization algorithm of real and complex polynomials: the factorization is only
guaranteed to succeed if the coefficients of the polynomial are rational numbers. 
In this work, we verify an algorithm to factor all real and complex polynomials
whose coefficients are algebraic. 
The existence of such an algorithm proves in a constructive way that the set of complex algebraic numbers
is algebraically closed.
Internally, the algorithm is based on resultants of multivariate 
polynomials and an approximation algorithm using interval arithmetic.

\section{Introduction}

The formalization of algebraic numbers \cite{Algebraic_Numbers,Algebraic_Numbers-AFP}
includes an algorithm that given
a univariate polynomial $f$ over $\ints$ or $\rats$, it computes all roots of $f$ within
$\reals$ or $\complex$. In this AFP entry we verify a generalized algorithm that also allows
polynomials as input whose coefficients are complex or real algebraic numbers, following 
\cite[Section~3]{jsc}. 

The verified algorithm internally computes resultants of
multivariate polynomials, where we utilize Braun and Traub's subresultant algorithm in our
verified implementation \cite{Brown,BrownTraub,Subresultants-AFP}. In this way we achieve an
efficient implementation with minimal effort: only a division algorithm for multivariate polynomials
is required, but no algorithm for computing greatest common divisors of these polynomials.
