\title{A Verified Reduction Algorithm from MLSSmf to MLSS}
\author{Yiran Duan, Lukas Stevens}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\textit{Multi-level syllogistic with monotone functions} (\mlssmf{}) is a sublanguage of set theory introduced by \citeauthor{mlssmf_II}~\cite{mlssmf_II}, 
involving set-to-set functions and their monotonicity, additivity, and multiplicativity. It is an extension of \textit{multi-level syllogistic with singleton} (\mlss{}), which involves the predicates membership, set equality, set inclusion, and the operators union, intersection, set difference, and singleton.

In this work we formalize the reduction algorithm from \mlssmf{} 
to \mlss{}, and verify the correctness proof originally presented by \citeauthor{mlssmf_II}~\cite{mlssmf_II}. Combined with the verified decision procedure for \mlss{} formalized by \citeauthor{MLSS_Decision_Proc-AFP}~\cite{MLSS_Decision_Proc-AFP}, this yields an executable and verified decision procedure for \mlssmf{}.
