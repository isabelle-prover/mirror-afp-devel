text \<open>The multiset-elements are either annotated variables or indices (of clauses).
  We basically follow the proof in \<^cite>\<open>"RPO_NPC"\<close> where these elements are encoded as terms 
  (and the relation is some fixed recursive path order).\<close>

text \<open>We encode a CNF into a multiset-problem, i.e., a quadruple (xs, ys, S, NS) where
  xs and ys are the lists to compare, and S and NS are underlying relations of the generalized multiset ordering.
  In the encoding, we add the strict relation S to the non-strict relation NS as this is a somewhat more
  natural order. In particular, the relations S and NS are precisely those that are obtained when using
  the mentioned recursive path order of \<^cite>\<open>"RPO_NPC"\<close>.\<close>
