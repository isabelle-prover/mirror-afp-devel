\title{Exploring Simplified Variants of Gödel's Ontological Argument in Isabelle/HOL}
\author{Christoph Benzm\"uller}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Simplified variants of Gödel's ontological argument are
  explored. Among those is a particularly interesting simplified
  argument which is (i) valid already in basic
  modal logics K or KT, (ii) which does not suffer from modal collapse,
  and (iii) which avoids the rather complex predicates of essence (Ess.)
  and necessary existence (NE) as used by Gödel.

  Whether the presented variants increase or decrease the
  attractiveness and persuasiveness of the ontological argument is a
  question I would like to pass on to philosophy and theology.

\section{Background Reading}
The selected simplified variants of Gödel's ontological argument
\cite{GoedelNotes,ScottNotes} as presented in \S\ref{sec:selected} have first been
extracted from the insights gained in \S6 of \cite{C85}. These variants are also influenced by the work
presented in \cite{J52} and they significantly extend the findings
from \cite{J28}. In \S\ref{sec:all} we additionally include the
sources from \cite{C85}.
