An Interface for Deserializing the certificates generated by [MLunta](https://gitlab.com/joshVM/mlunta).

To compile this with MLton one has to have the `basics.ML` and `library.ML` file
from [Munta](https://github.com/wimmers/munta/tree/master/ML).

Then one can use the mlb file by setting the path variable in mlton
by running

`mlton -mlb-path-var 'ISALIB path_to_library.ML' -mlb-path-var 'ISABASICS path_to_basics.ML' build.mlb`.
