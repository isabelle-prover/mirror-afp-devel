\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We develop a framework for reasoning computationally about $p$-adic fields via formal Laurent
  series with integer coefficients.
  We define a ring-class quotient type consisting of equivalence classes of prime-indexed
  sequences of formal Laurent series,
  in which every $p$-adic field is contained as a subring.
  Via a further quotient of the ring of $p$-adic integers
  (that is, the elements of depth at least $0$) by the prime ideal
  (that is, the subring of elements of depth at least $1$),
  we define a ring-class type in which every prime-order finite field is contained as a subring.
  Finally, some topological properties are developed using depth as a proxy for a metric,
  Hensel's Lemma is proved,
  and the compactness of local rings of integers is established.
