\begin{abstract}
Tree automata have good closure properties and therefore a commonly
used to prove/disprove properties. This formalization contains
among other things the proofs of many closure properties of tree automata
(anchored) ground tree transducers and regular relations.
Additionally it includes the well known pumping lemma and a lifting of
the Myhill Nerode theorem for regular languages to tree languages.

We want to mention the existence of a tree automata APF-entry developed by
Peter Lammich. His work is based on epsilon free top-down tree automata,
while this entry builds on bottom-up tree auotamta with epsilon transitions.
Moreover our formalization relies on the Collections Framework also by Peter
Lammich \cite{Collections-AFP} to obtain efficient code.
All proven constructions of the closure properties are exportable using
the Isabelle/HOL code generation facilities.

\section{Introduction}

Tree automata characterize a computable subset of term languages
which are called regular tree languages. These languages are closed
under union, intersection, and complement. Due to their nice closure
properties tree automata techniques are frequently used to prove/disprove
properties.

As an example consider the field of rewriting.
Dauchet and Tison showed that the theory of ground rewrite systems is decidable \cite{DT90}.
As another example, Kucherov et.al. proved that the regularity of the normal forms
induced by a rewrite system is decidable \cite{KGTM}.

In this formalization we also consider (anchored) ground tree transducers ((A)GTTs)
and regular relations. The first allows to reason about relations on
regular tree languages and the latter to reason about tuples of arbitrary size
over regular tree languages. We distinguish them as they have different
closure properties. While (anchored) ground tree transducers are closed
under transitivity, regular relations are not. Additional information about
these constructions and their closure properties can be found in \cite{LMMF21}.

This APF-entry provides a formalization of the general tree automata theory, GTTs,
and regular relations. Moreover it contains a newly developed theory on the topic of
AGTTs (construction is equivalent to the definition of $Rec_2$ in TATA \cite[Chapter~3]{tata2007})
and how they are related to regular GTTs.

We want to mention the existence of a tree automata APF-entry developed by
Peter Lammich \cite{Tree-Automata-AFP}. The main reason for developing
a new tree automata theory instead of working on top of his work was
the underlying tree automata definition. Whereas our formalization defines
bottom-up tree automaton with epsilon transitions, Peter Lammichs defines
top-down tree automaton without epsilon transitions. These definitions do not differ
in expressibility (i.e. a language is recognized by a bottom-up tree automaton
if and only if it is recognized by a top-down tree automaton), however the
use of epsilon transitions simplifies many constructions.
