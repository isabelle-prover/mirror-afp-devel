text \<open>This section is a tutorial for the use of pseudorandom objects. Starting from the
approximation algorithm for the second frequency moment by Alon et al.~\cite{alon1999}, we will
improve the solution until we achieve a space complexity of
$\mathcal O(\ln n + \varepsilon^{-2} \ln(\delta^{-1}) \ln m)$, where $n$ denotes the range of the
stream elements, $m$ denotes the length of the stream, $\varepsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy
and $\delta$ denotes the desired failure probability.

The construction relies on a combination of pseudorandom object, in particular an expander walk
and two chained hash families.\<close>
