\<open>In a binary grammar, every right-hand side consists of at most two symbols. The \<open>binarize\<close> function should convert an
 arbitrary production list into a binary production list, without changing the language of the grammar. For this we make use
 of fixpoint iteration and define the function \<open>binarize1\<close> for splitting a production, whose right-hand side exceeds the
 maximum number of symbols 2, into two productions. The step function is then defined as the auxiliary function \<open>binarize'\<close>.
 We also define the count function \<open>count\<close> that counts the right-hand sides whose length is more than or equal to 2\<close>

fun binarize1 :: "('n :: fresh0, 't) prods \<Rightarrow> ('n, 't) prods \<Rightarrow> ('n, 't) prods" where
  "binarize1 ps' [] = []"
| "binarize1 ps' ((A, []) # ps) = (A, []) # binarize1 ps' ps"
| "binarize1 ps' ((A, s0 # u) # ps) =
 (if length u \<le> 1 then (A, s0 # u) # binarize1 ps' ps
  else let B = fresh0 (nts ps') in (A,[s0, Nt B]) # (B, u) # ps)"

definition binarize' :: "('n::fresh0, 't) prods \<Rightarrow> ('n, 't) prods" where
  "binarize' ps = binarize1 ps ps"

fun count :: "('n::infinite, 't) prods \<Rightarrow> nat" where
  "count [] = 0"
| "count ((A,u) # ps) = (if length u \<le> 2 then count ps else length u + count ps)"

definition binarize :: "('n::fresh0, 't) prods \<Rightarrow> ('n, 't) prods" where
