\title{HOL-CSP\_PTick\\Parameterized Termination for Sequential Composition
and Synchronization Product}
\author{Benoît Ballenghien}
\maketitle
\chapter*{Abstract}

Recently, parameterized termination has been introduced in \verb'HOL-CSP', allowing
the termination event \verb'tick' to carry a result value, in a way analogous to
the \verb'return' of a state monad. This conservative extension of the CSP theory
required the generalization of several denotational definitions and the adaptation
of numerous proofs. Since Isabelle2025, this work has been completed for the
\verb'HOL-CSP', \verb'HOL-CSPM', and \verb'HOL-CSP_OpSem' sessions.
However, for two operators---namely sequential composition and the synchronization
product---the most direct generalizations turn out to be conceptually unsatisfactory,
in particular with respect to their interaction with $SKIP$. To address this issue,
we introduce in this entry generalized versions of these operators that
fully exploit the expressive power of parameterized termination; in particular, the
resulting notion of sequential composition satisfies the monad laws. Building on
these definitions, we establish a range of algebraic and operational laws, as well as
fundamental properties such as continuity and non-destructiveness.
