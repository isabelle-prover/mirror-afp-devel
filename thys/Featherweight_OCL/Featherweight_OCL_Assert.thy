section\<open>Miscelleaneous: ML assertions\<close>

text\<open>We introduce here a new command \emph{Assert} similar as \emph{value} for proving
 that the given term in argument is a true proposition. The difference with \emph{value} is that
\emph{Assert} fails if the normal form of the term evaluated is not equal to @{term True}. 
Moreover, in case \emph{value} could not normalize the given term, as another strategy of reduction
 we try to prove it with a single ``simp'' tactic.\<close>
