\begin{abstract}
In \cite{Zankl2013-AFP} it was formally proved that the decreasing diagrams method \cite{Oostrom94} is sound for proving confluence: if a binary relation $r$ has $LD$ property defined in \cite{Zankl2013-AFP}, then it has $CR$ property defined in \cite{Sternagel2010-AFP}. 

In this formal theory it is proved that if the cardinality of $r$ does not exceed the first uncountable cardinal, then $r$ has $CR$ property if and only if $r$ has $LD$ property. As a consequence, the decreasing diagrams method is complete for proving confluence of relations of the least uncountable cardinality. 

A paper that describes details of this proof has been submitted to the FSCD 2025 conference. This formalization extends formalizations \cite{formal1,formal2,formal3,formal4} and the paper \cite{IWC24}.
