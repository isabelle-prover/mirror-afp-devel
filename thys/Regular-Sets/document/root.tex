\title{Regular Sets, Expressions, Derivatives and Relation Algebra}
\author{Alexander Krauss, Tobias Nipkow,\\

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a library of constructions on regular expressions and languages.  It
provides the operations of concatenation, Kleene star and left-quotients of
languages. A theory of derivatives and partial derivatives is
provided. Arden's lemma and finiteness of partial derivatives is
established. An executable equivalence checker for regular expressions is
verified; it does not need automata but works directly on regular
expressions. By mapping regular expressions to binary relations, an
automatic and complete proof method for (in)equalities of binary relations
over union, concatenation and (reflexive) transitive closure is obtained.

For an exposition of the equivalence checker for regular and relation
algebraic expressions see the paper by Krauss and Nipkow~\cite{KraussN-JAR}.
