\begin{abstract}
The \Circus\ specification language combines elements for complex data and behavior specifications, 
using an integration of Z and CSP with a refinement calculus. Its semantics is based on Hoare and He's
Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP).

Isabelle/\Circus\ is a formalization of the UTP and the \Circus\ language in Isabelle/HOL.
It contains proof rules and tactic support that allows for proofs
of refinement for Circus processes (involving both data and behavioral aspects).

The Isabelle/\Circus\ environment supports a syntax for the semantic definitions which is close to 
textbook presentations of Circus.

This article contains an extended version of \cite{DBLP:conf/vstte/FeliachiGW12} together with the 
complete  formal development of its underlying commented theories. It supersedes the technical report

\section{Introduction} 
Many systems involve both complex (sometimes infinite) data structures and interactions 
between concurrent processes. Refinement of abstract specifications of such systems into 
more concrete ones, requires an appropriate formalisation of 
refinement and appropriate proof support.

There are several combinations of process-oriented modeling languages
with data-oriented specification formalisms such as Z or B or CASL; examples
are discussed in \cite{Butler99csp2b:a,Fischer1998,Taguchi1997,Roggenbach:2006}.
In this paper, we consider \Circus\ \cite{WC02}, a
language for refinement, that supports modeling of high-level
specifications, designs, and concrete programs. It is representative
of a class of languages that provide facilities to model data types,
using a predicate-based notation, and patterns of interactions, without imposing 
architectural restrictions. It is this feature that makes
it suitable for reasoning about both abstract and low-level
designs. 

We present a ``shallow embedding'' of the \Circus\
semantics enabling state variables and channels in \Circus\ to have
arbitrary HOL types. Therefore, the entire handling of typing can be
completely shifted to the (efficiently implemented) Isabelle
type-checker and is therefore implicit in proofs. This drastically
simplifies definitions and proofs, and makes the reuse of
standardized proof procedures possible. Compared to implementations
based on a ``deep embedding'' such as \cite{ZC09} this significantly improves the
usability of the resulting proof environment.

Our representation brings particular technical challenges and contributions concerning
some important notions about variables. Since the original \Circus\ definition
has in parts a highly syntactic flavor, a reformulation in semantic terms is
necessary. The main challenge is to represent alphabets 
and bindings in a typed way that preserves the semantics and improves deduction. 
We provide  a representation of bindings without an explicit management of alphabets. 
As a consequence, the  representation of some core concepts in the unifying theories of programming 
(UTP) and \Circus\ constructs like variable scopes and renaming needed a different treatment. 
We propose a (stack-based) solution that allows the coding of state variables 
scoping with no need for renaming. This solution is even a contribution to the UTP theory that 
does not allow nested variable scoping. 

This paper is organized as follows. We give a high-level overview of the 
key concepts of our semantic representation in Sections \ref{foundation} and
\ref{conceptual_overview}, which is then refined in the Section 5 - 10. Section \ref{Section:framework}
is again a high-level description over the \emph{use} of Isabelle/\Circus/ environment
demonstrated at an refinement example. The corresponding
formal presentation of this part is contained in Section \ref{Refinement}. 
(We will present it both in high-level syntax as well as "Code" in terms of our semantic embedding; 
however, we refrain to include ML-code in this presentation that comrpises the parser supporting this
syntax; the interested reader is referred to: \url{http://www.lri.fr/~feliachi/IsabelleCircus/}) . 
Thus, in this paper, we focus on giving details on what
is happening ``behind the scenes'' when the system parses each part of the specification. In the last part of 
this section, we show how to write proofs based on specifications, and give a refinement proof example.

This article contains an extended version of \cite{DBLP:conf/vstte/FeliachiGW12} together with the complete 
formal development of its commented theories (superseding \cite{fgw11rapport-lri}). 

\section{\Circus\ and its UTP Foundation at a Glance}\label{foundation}
\Circus\ is a formal specification language \cite{WC02} which
integrates the notions of states and complex data types (in a Z-like
style) and communicating parallel processes inspired from CSP.
From Z, the language inherits the notion of a schema used to
model sets of (ground) states as well as syntactic machinery to describe
pre-states and post-states; from CSP, the language inherits 
the concept of \emph{communication events} and typed communication channels, 
the concepts of deterministic and non-deterministic choice
(reflected by the process combinators $P~\square~P'$ and $P~\sqcap~P'$),
the concept of concealment (hiding) $P \backslash A$ of events in $A$ occurring in 
in the evolution of process $P$.

Due to the presence of state variables, the \Circus\  synchronous communication operator 
syntax is slightly different frome CSP:  $P\ \llbracket\ n \ |\ c\ |\ n'\ \rrbracket P'$ means that 
$P$ and $P'$ communicate via the channels mentioned in $c$; moreover, $P$ may modify 
the variables mentioned in $n$ only, and $P'$ in $n'$ only, $n$ and $n'$ are disjoint name sets.

Moreover, the language comes with a formal notion of refinement based on a 
denotational semantics. It follows the failure/divergence semantics \cite{Roscoe:1997:TPC:550448}, 
(but coined in terms of the UTP \cite{CircusDS}) providing a notion of execution trace \inlineisar+tr+, 
refusals \inlineisar+ref+, and divergences. It is expressed in terms of the UTP \cite{HJ98} 
which makes it amenable to other refinement-notions in UTP. 
Figure \ref{figure:Fig} presents a simple \Circus\ specification,  \inlineisar+FIG+, 
the fresh identifiers generator.

 \caption{\label{figure:CircSynt} Isabelle/\Circus\ syntax}
%\vspace{-0.4 cm}
\end{figure}

The Isabelle/\Circus\ environment allows a syntax of processes which is 
close to the textbook presentations of \Circus\ (see Fig. \ref{figure:CircSynt}). 
Similar to other specification 
constructs in Isabelle/HOL, this syntax is ``parsed away", \ie{} compiled into an internal 
representation of the denotational semantics of \Circus , which is a formalization in form of a 
shallow embedding of the (essentially untyped) paper-and-pencil definitions by Oliveira et al.
\cite{CircusDS}, based on UTP. \Circus\ actions are defined as CSP healthy reactive processes.

In the UTP representation of reactive
processes we have given in a previous paper \cite{feliachi:uznifying-theories:2010},   
the process type is generic. 
It contains two type parameters that represent the channel type and the
alphabet of the process. These parameters are very general, and they
are instantiated for each specific process. This could be problematic
when representing the \Circus\ semantics, since some definitions
rely directly on variables and channels (e.g assignment and
communication).  In this section we present our solution to deal with
this kind of problems, and our representation of the \Circus\ actions
and processes.

We now describe the foundation as well as the semantic definition
of some process operators of \Circus . A distinguishing feature of \Circus\ processes are
explicit state variables which do not exist in other process algebras like, e.g., CSP. 
These can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{global} state variables, \ie{} they are declared via alphabetized predicates in
the \inlineisar+state+ section, or Z-like $\Delta$ operations on global states that generate
alphabetized relations, or 
\item \emph{local} state variables, \ie{} they are result of the variable declaration statement $\mathsf{\textbf{var}\ var\ @\ Action }$.
         The scope of local variables is restricted to  $\mathsf{Action}$.
\end{itemize}
On both kind of state variables, logical constraints may be expressed.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Isabelle/\Circus }{Isabelle/Circus}: A Conceptual Overview.}\label{conceptual_overview}
\label{Section:CircusHOL}
As mentioned earlier, a number of features of the UTP and \Circus\ have a distinctively syntactic 
flavor; their reformulation in semantic terms is the most tricky pre-requisite for a semantics in \HOL.
In this section, we focus on the the key ingredients and principles of the environment underlying the
chapters 5 to 11.
   
\subsection{Encoding Alphabets in HOL}\label{sec:Encoding_Alphabets}
Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) is a semantic framework based on
an alphabetized relational calculus. An alphabetized predicate is a pair (alphabet, predicate)
where the free variables appearing in the predicate are all in the alphabet.

An alphabetized relation is an alphabetized predicate where the alphabet is
composed of input (undecorated) and output (dashed) variables. In this case the
predicate describes a relation between input and output variables.

The key idea of this shallow semantic interpretation of the UTP and \Circus\
is to use \emph{extensible records} for the representation of alphabetized
predicates and relations.

Isabelle/HOL's support for \emph{extensible records} is of particular importance
for our work.
Record types are denoted, for example, by:
\begin{isar}
 record T =  a::T_1
             b::T_2
\end{isar}
which implicitly introduces the record constructor \inlineisar+(|a:=e_1,b:=e_2|)+
and the update of record r in field a, written as \inlineisar+r(|a:= x|)+.
Extensible records are represented internally by cartesian products with an
implicit free component $\delta$, i.e. in this case by a triple of the type
\inlineisar+T_1 \<times> T_2 \<times> \<delta>+. The third component can be referenced
by a \emph{special selector}   \inlineisar+more+ available on extensible records.
Thus, the record \inlineisar+T+ can be
extended later on using the syntax:
\begin{isar}
 record ET =  T +  c::T_3
\end{isar}
The key point is that theorems can be established, once and for all,
on \inlineisar+T+ types, even if future parts of the record are not
yet known, and reused in the later definition and proofs over
\inlineisar+ET+-values.
Using this feature, we can model the effect of defining the
alphabet of UTP processes incrementally while maintaining
the full expressivity of HOL wrt. the types of
\inlineisar+T_1+, \inlineisar+T_2+ and \inlineisar+T_3+.

In the following, we explain how the concept of
extensible record is used as a semantic representation
of the concept of an alphabet.

The UTP is a semantic framework based on an alphabetized relational
calculus. An \emph{alphabetized predicate} is a pair ($alphabet$,
$predicate$) where the free variables appearing in the predicate are
all in the alphabet, e.g. $(\{x, y\}, x > y)$. As such, it is very similar to
the concept of a \emph{schema} in Z. In the base theory Isabelle/UTP
of this work, we represent alphabetized predicates  by sets of (extensible)open 
records, e.g.  \inlineisar+{A. x A > y A}+.


An \emph{alphabetized relation} is an alphabetized predicate where the
alphabet is composed of input (undecorated) and output (dashed)
variables. In this case the predicate describes a relation between
input and output variables, for example $(\{x, x', y, y'\}, x' = x + y)$
which is a notation for: \inlineisar*{(A,A').x A' = x A + y A}*, which is
a set of pairs, thus a relation.

The formal representation of these basics is covered in \ref{sec:UTP_Core_Definitions}.

\subsection{Alphabets and Variables}
%
In order to define the set of variables of a specification, the \Circus\  semantics  
considers the alphabet of its components, 
be it on the level of alphabetized predicates, alphabetized relations or actions. 
We recall that
these items are represented by sets of records or sets of pairs of records. 
The \emph{alphabet of a process} is defined by extending the basic reactive process 
alphabet (cf. Section \ref{Reactive_Processes} ) by its variable names and types. 
For the running example $FIG$, where the global state variable $idS$ is defined, this is
reflected in Isabelle/Circus by the extension of the process alphabet by this variable, i.e. 
by the extension of the Isabelle/HOL record:
\begin{isar}
record \<alpha>  alpha = \<alpha>  alpha_rp +   idS :: ID set
\end{isar}
This introduces the record type \inlineisar+alpha+ that contains the observational variables 
of a reactive process, plus the variable \inlineisar+idS+. Note that  our \Circus\ semantic 
representation allows  ``built-in'' bindings of alphabets in a typed way. 
Moreover, there is no restriction on the associated HOL type. However, the inconvenience of this 
representation is that variables cannot be introduced ``on the fly''; must be known statically i.e. at 
type inference time. Another consequence is that a "syntactic" operation such as variable renaming 
has to be expressed as a "semantic" operation that maps one record type into another.

\subsubsection{Updating and accessing global variables.}\label{sec:updating_global}
Since the alphabets are represented by HOL records, i.e. a kind binding "$name \mapsto value$",
we need a certain infrastructure to access data in them and to update them. The Isabelle 
representation as records gives us already two functions (for each record)``select'' and ``update''. 
The ``select'' function returns the value of a given variable name, and the ``update'' functions 
updates the value of this variable. Since we may have different HOL types for different variables, 
a unique definition for select and update cannot be provided. There is an instance of these 
functions for each variable in the record. The name of the variable is used to distinguish the 
different instances: for the select function the name is used directly and for the update function 
the name is used as a prefix e.g. for a variable named ``x" the names of the \emph{select} and 
\emph{update} functions are respectively \inlineisar+x+ of type \inlineisar+\<alpha>+ and 
\inlineisar+x_update+.

Since a variable is characterized essentially by these functions, we define a general type (synonym) 
called \inlineisar+var+ which represents a variable as a pair of its select and update function 
(in the underlying state \inlineisar+\<sigma>+).
\begin{isar} 
 types (\<beta>, \<sigma>) var = "(\<sigma> \<Rightarrow>  \<beta>) * ((\<beta>  \<Rightarrow> \<beta>) \<Rightarrow> \<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<sigma>)"
\end{isar}

For a given alphabet (record) of type \inlineisar+\<sigma>+, \inlineisar+(\<beta>, the type \<sigma>) var+ represents 
the type of the variables whose value type is \inlineisar+\<beta>+. 
One can then extract the select and update functions from a given variable with the following functions:
\begin{isar}
 definition select :: "(\<beta>, \<sigma>) var \<Rightarrow>   \<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<beta>"
   where select f \<equiv>   (fst f)

 definition update :: "(\<beta>, \<sigma>) var \<Rightarrow>    \<beta> \<Rightarrow> \<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<sigma>"
   where update f v \<equiv>   (snd f) (\<lambda> _ . v)
\end{isar}

Finally, we introduce a function called \inlineisar+VAR+ to implement a syntactic translation of a 
variable name to an entity of type \inlineisar+var+.
\begin{isar}
syntax "_VAR" :: "id \<Rightarrow> (\<beta>, \<sigma>) var"  ("VAR _")
translations VAR x => (x, _update_ name x)
\end{isar}
Note that in this syntactic translation rule, \inlineisar+_update_ name x+ stands for the 
concatenation of the string \inlineisar+_update_+ with the content of the variable  \inlineisar+x+; 
the resulting \inlineisar+_update_x+ in this example is mapped to the field-update function of the 
extensible record \inlineisar+x_update+ by a default mechanism. 
On this basis, the assignment notation can be written as usual:
\begin{isar}
syntax
  "_assign" :: "id \<Rightarrow> (\<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<beta>) \<Rightarrow> (\<alpha>, \<sigma>) action"  ("_ `:=` _")
translations
  "x `:=` E"   => "CONST ASSIGN (VAR x) E"
\end{isar}
%but 
and mapped to the \emph{semantics} of the program variable \inlineisar+(x,x_update)+ together with 
the universal \inlineisar+ASSIGN+ operator defined later on, in Section \ref{sec:assignment_action}.
\begin{comment}
as follows:
\begin{isar}
definition
  ASSIGN::"(\<beta>, \<sigma>) var \<Rightarrow> (\<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<beta>) \<Rightarrow> (\<alpha>::ev_eq, \<sigma>) action"
where
  ASSIGN x e \<equiv>   ...
\end{isar}
The details in this definition based on UTP and embedded into \Circus-Actions can be found in 
Section \ref{sec:assignment_action}.
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Updating and accessing local variables.}
In \Circus , local program variables can be introduced on the fly, and their scopes are explicitly 
defined, as can be seen in the %\inlineisar+Fig+  $FIG$ example. 
In textbook \Circus , nested scopes are handled by variable renaming which is not possible in our 
representation due to the implicit representation of variable names.
%Instead, w
We represent local program variables by global variables, %i.e. 
using the \inlineisar+var+ type defined above, where selection and update involve an explicit 
stack discipline. Each variable is mapped to a list of values, and not to one value only 
(as for state variables). Entering the scope of a variable 
%corresponds to 
is just adding a new value as the head of the corresponding values list. Leaving a variable scope 
is just removing the head of the values list. The select and update functions correspond to selecting 
and updating the head of the list. This ensures dynamic scoping, as it is stated by the \Circus\ 
semantics. 

Note that this encoding scheme requires to make local variables lexically distinct from global variables; local
variable instances are just distinguished from the global ones by the stack discipline. 

\subsection{Synchronization infrastructure: Name sets and channels.}
\label{Section:NSandCS}
\subsubsection{Name sets.}
An important notion, used in the definition of parallel \Circus\ actions, is name sets
as seen in Section \ref{sec:Encoding_Alphabets}. A name set is a set of variable names, which is a subset of 
the alphabet. This notion cannot be directly expressed in our representation since variable names 
are not explicitly represented. %Its definition is a bit tricky and 
Thus its definition relies on the characterization of the variables in our representation. As for 
variables, name sets are defined by their functional 
characterization. They are used in the definition of the binding merge function $MSt$ below:\\
{\footnotesize $\forall v @ (v \in ns1 \Rightarrow v' = (1.v)) \land (v \in ns2 \Rightarrow v' = (2.v)) 
\land (v \notin ns1 \cup ns2 \Rightarrow v' = v)$}.

The disjoint name sets $ns1$ and $ns2$ are used to determine which variable values (extracted from
local bindings of the parallel components) are used to update the global binding of the process. 
A name set can be functionally defined as a binding update function, that 
copies values from a local binding to the global one. For example, a name set $NS$ that only 
contains the variable $x$ can be defined as follows in Isabelle/Circus:
\begin{isar}
definition NS lb gb \<equiv>    x_update (x lb) gb
\end{isar}

\noindent where  \inlineisar+lb+ and \inlineisar+gb+ stands for local and global bindings, 
\inlineisar+x+ and \inlineisar+x_update+ are the select and update functions of variable 
\inlineisar+x+. Then the merge function can be defined by composing the application of the name 
sets to the global binding.

\subsubsection{Channels.}
Reactive processes interact with the environment via synchronizations and communications. A 
synchronization is an interaction via a channel without any exchange of data. A communication is a 
synchronization with data exchange. In order to reason about communications in the same way, 
a datatype $channels$ is defined using the channels names as constructors.
For instance, in:
\begin{isar}
datatype channels = chan1 | chan2 nat | chan3 bool
\end{isar}

%In this example, we 
\noindent we declare three channels: \inlineisar+chan1+ that synchronizes without data , 
\inlineisar+chan2+ that communicates natural values and \inlineisar+chan3+ that exchanges boolean values.

This definition %allows us 
makes it possible to reason globally about communications since they have the same type. 
However, the channels may not have the same type:
in the example above, the types of \inlineisar+chan1+, \inlineisar+chan2+ and \inlineisar+chan3+ are 
respectively \inlineisar+channels+, \inlineisar+nat \<Rightarrow> channels+ and \inlineisar+bool \<Rightarrow> channels+. 
In the definition of some \Circus\ operators, we need to compare two channels, 
%It is not directly possible in our case. %for two reasons. 
and one can't compare for example \inlineisar+chan1+ with \inlineisar+chan2+ since they don't have 
the same type. A solution would be to compare %for example 
\inlineisar+chan1+ with (\inlineisar+chan2 v+). The types are equivalent in this case, but the problem 
remains because comparing (\inlineisar+chan2 0+) to (\inlineisar+chan2 1+) will state inequality just 
because the communicated values are not equal. We could define an inductive function over the datatype 
\inlineisar+channels+ to compare channels, but this is only possible when all the channels are known $a~priori$. 

Thus,  %when we need to provide a general definition, we %only need to 
we add some constraint to the generic channels type: we require the \inlineisar+channels+ type to 
implement a function \inlineisar+chan_eq+ that tests the equality of two channels. Fortunately, 
Isabelle/HOL provides a %feature that allows 
construct for this kind of restriction: the type classes (sorts) mentioned in Section \ref{IsaHOL}. 
We define a type class (interface) \inlineisar+chan_eq+ that contains a signature of the \inlineisar+chan_eq+ function.
\begin{isar}
class chan_eq = 
  fixes chan_eq :: "\<alpha> \<Rightarrow>  \<alpha>  \<Rightarrow> bool"
begin end
\end{isar}
Concrete channels type %should 
must implement the interface (class) `` \inlineisar+chan_eq+'' that can be easily defined for this 
concrete type. Moreover, one can use this class to add some definition that depends on the channel 
equivalence function. For example, a trace equivalence function can be defined as follows:
\begin{isar}
fun tr_eq where
  tr_eq [] [] = True | tr_eq xs [] = False | tr_eq [] ys = False
| tr_eq (x#xs) (y#ys) = if chan_eq x y then tr_eq xs ys else False
\end{isar}
It is applicable to traces of elements whose type belongs to the sort \inlineisar+chan_eq+.

\subsection{Actions and Processes}
\label{ActionsAndP}
The \Circus\ actions type is defined as the set of all the CSP healthy reactive processes. 
The type \inlineisar+(\<alpha>,\<sigma>)relation_rp+ is the reactive process type where 
\inlineisar+\<alpha>+ is of \inlineisar+channels+ type and 
\inlineisar+\<sigma>+ is a record extensions of \inlineisar+action_rp+, \ie{} the global state variables.
On this basis, we can encode the concept of a process for a family of possible state instances.
We introduce below the vital type \inlineisar+action+:
\begin{isar}
typedef(Action)
 (\<alpha>::chan_eq,\<sigma>) action = {p::(\<alpha>,\<sigma>)relation_rp. is_CSP_process p}
proof - {...} 
qed
\end{isar}
As mentioned before, a type-definition introduces a new type by stating a set. In our case it is the set
of reactive processes that satisfy the healthiness-conditions for CSP-processes, isomorphic to the new type.

Technically, this %specification 
construct introduces two constants definitions \inlineisar+Abs_Action+ and \inlineisar+Rep_Action+ 
respectively of type  \inlineisar+(\<alpha>,\<sigma>) relation_rp \<Rightarrow> (\<alpha>,\<sigma>) action+ and
\inlineisar+(\<alpha>,\<sigma>)action \<Rightarrow>(\<alpha>,\<sigma>)relation_rp+ as well as the
usual two axioms expressing the bijection \inlineisar+Abs_Action(Rep_Action(X))=X+ and 
\inlineisar+is_CSP_process p \<Longrightarrow> Rep_Action(Abs_Action(p))=p+ where
\inlineisar+is_CSP_process+ captures the healthiness conditions. 

Every \Circus\ action is an abstraction of an alphabetized predicate. In \ref{Denotational}, we 
introduce the definitions of all the actions  and operators using their denotational semantics. 
The environment contains, for each action, the proof that this predicate  is CSP healthy.
In this section, we present some of the important definitions, namely: basic actions, assignments, 
communications, hiding, and recursion.

\subsubsection{Basic actions.}
\inlineisar+Stop+ is defined as a reactive design, with a precondition \inlineisar+true+ and
a postcondition stating that the system deadlocks and the traces are 
not evolving.
\begin{isar}
definition 
Stop \<equiv>   Abs_Action (R (true \<turnstile> \<lambda> (A, A'). tr A' = tr A \<and>    wait A'))
\end{isar}

\inlineisar+Skip+ is defined as a reactive design, with a precondition $true$ and
a postcondition stating that the system terminates and all the state variables are not changed. 
We represent this fact by stating that the \inlineisar+more+ field (seen in  Section \ref{sec:Encoding_Alphabets}) 
is not changed, since this field is mapped to all the state variables. Note
that using the \inlineisar+more+-field is a tribute to our encoding of alphabets by extensible records
and stands for all future extensions of the alphabet (e.g. state variables).

\begin{isar}
definition Skip \<equiv>    Abs_Action (R (true \<turnstile>   \<lambda> (A, A'). tr A' = tr A 
                                       \<and> \<not> wait A' \<and>  more A = more A'))
\end{isar}


\subsubsection{The universal assignment action.}\label{sec:assignment_action}
In Section \ref{sec:updating_global}, we described how global and local variables are represented
by access- and updates functions introduced by fields in extensible records. In these terms, the
 "lifting" to the assignment action in \Circus\ processes is straightforward:
\begin{isar}
definition
  ASSIGN::"(\<beta>, \<sigma>) var \<Rightarrow> (\<sigma> \<Rightarrow> \<beta>) \<Rightarrow> (\<alpha>::ev_eq, \<sigma>) action"
where
  ASSIGN x e \<equiv>   Abs_Action (R (true \<turnstile>   Y))
where
 Y = \<lambda> (A, A'). tr A' = tr A \<and>    \<not> wait A' \<and> 
                  more A' = (assign x (e (more A))) (more A)
\end{isar}
where \inlineisar+assign+ is the projection into the update operation of a semantic variable 
described in section \ref{sec:updating_global}.

\subsubsection{Communications.}
The definition of prefixed actions is based on the definition of a
special relation \inlineisar+do_I+. 
In the \Circus\ denotational semantics \cite{CircusDS},
various forms of prefixing were defined. In our theory, we define one
general form, and the other forms are defined as special cases.
\begin{isar}
definition do_I c x P \<equiv>     X  \<triangleleft> wait o fst \<triangleright>   Y
where
X = (\<lambda> (A, A'). tr A = tr A' \<and>     ((c ` P) \<inter>  ref A') = {})
and
Y = (\<lambda> (A, A'). hd ((tr A') - (tr A)) \<in>      (c ` P) \<and> 
     (c (select x (more A))) = (last (tr A')))
\end{isar}
where \inlineisar+c+ is a channel constructor, \inlineisar+x+ is a variable (of \inlineisar+var+ type) 
and \inlineisar+P+ is a predicate. The \inlineisar+do_I+ relation gives the semantics of an interaction: 
if the system is ready to interact, the trace is unchanged and the waiting channel is not refused. 
After performing the interaction, the new event in the trace corresponds to this interaction. 

The semantics of the whole action is given by the following definition:
\begin{isar}
definition Prefix c x P S \<equiv>    Abs_Action(R (true \<turnstile>   Y)) ; S
where
Y =  do_I c x P \<and>   (\<lambda> (A, A'). more A' = more A)
\end{isar}
where \inlineisar+c+ is a channel constructor, \inlineisar+x+ is a variable (of type var), 
\inlineisar+P+ is a predicate and \inlineisar+S+ is an action. This definition states that the 
prefixed action semantics is given by the interaction semantics (\inlineisar+do_I+) sequentially 
composed with the semantics of the continuation (action \inlineisar+S+).


Different types of communication are considered: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Inputs: the communication is done over a variable.
\item Constrained Inputs: the input variable value is constrained with a predicate.
\item Outputs: the communications exchanges only one value.
\item Synchronizations: only the channel name is considered (no data).
\end{itemize}

The semantics of these different forms of communications is based on the general definition above.
\begin{isar}
definition read c x P  \<equiv>   Prefix c x true P
definition write1 c a P \<equiv>    Prefix c (\<lambda>s. a s, (\<lambda> x. \<lambda>y. y)) true P
definition write0 c P \<equiv>    Prefix (\<lambda>_.c) (\<lambda>_._, (\<lambda> x. \<lambda>y. y)) true P
\end{isar}
where \inlineisar+read+, \inlineisar+write1+ and \inlineisar+write0+ respectively correspond to 
inputs, outputs and synchronization. Constrained~ inputs correspond to the general definition. 

We configure the Isabelle syntax-engine such that it parses the usual
communication primitives and gives the corresponding semantics:
\begin{isar}
translations
  c ? p \<rightarrow> P      == CONST read c (VAR p) P
  c ? p : b \<rightarrow> P  == CONST Prefix c (VAR p) b P
  c ! p \<rightarrow> P      == CONST write1 c p P
  a \<rightarrow> P          == CONST write0 (TYPE(_)) a P
\end{isar}

\subsubsection{Hiding.}
The hiding operator is interesting because it depends on a channel set. This operator 
\inlineisar+P \ cs+ is used to encapsulate the events that are in the channel set \inlineisar+cs+. 
These events become no longer visible from the environment. The semantics of the hiding operator is 
given by the following reactive process:

\begin{isar}
definition
Hide ::"[(\<alpha>, \<sigma>) action , \<alpha>    set] \<Rightarrow> (\<alpha>, \<sigma>) action" (infixl "\")
where  
P \ cs \<equiv>  Abs_Action( R(\<lambda> (A, A'). 
           \<exists> s. (Rep_Action P)(A, A'\<lparr>tr :=s, ref := (ref A') \<union>       cs\<rparr>) 
               \<and> (tr A' - tr A) = (tr_filter (s - tr A) cs))); Skip
\end{isar}

The definition uses a filtering function \inlineisar+tr_filter+ that removes from a trace the events 
whose channels belong to a given set. The definition of this function is based on the function 
\inlineisar+chan_eq+ we defined in the class \inlineisar+chan_eq+. This explains the presence of the 
constraint on the type of the action channels in the hiding definition, and in the definition of the 
filtering function below:

\begin{isar}
fun tr_filter::"a::chan_eq list \<Rightarrow> a set \<Rightarrow> a list" where
  tr_filter [] cs = []
| tr_filter (x#xs) cs = (if (\<not> chan-in_set x cs) 
                              then (x#(tr_filter xs cs))
                                else (tr_filter xs cs))
\end{isar}

\noindent where the \inlineisar+chan-in_set+ function checks if a given channel belongs to a channel 
set using \inlineisar+chan_eq+ as equality function.


\subsubsection{Recursion.}
To represent the recursion operator ``$\mu$'' over actions, we use the universal least fix-point 
operator ``$lfp$'' defined in the HOL library for lattices and we follow again \cite{CircusDS}. 
The use of least fix-points in \cite{CircusDS} is the most substantial deviation from the standard 
CSP denotational semantics, which requires Scott-domains and complete partial orderings.
The operator $lfp$ is inherited from the ``$Complete~Lattice~class$'' under some conditions, 
and all theorems defined over this operator can be reused. 
In order to reuse this operator, we have to show that the least-fixpoint over functionals that 
enrich pairs of failure - and divergence trace sets monotonely, produces an \inlineisar+action+ 
that satisfies the CSP healthiness conditions. This consistency proof for the recursion operator 
is the largest contained in the Isabelle/\Circus\ library.

%In order to reuse the $lfp$ operator and its inherited proofs
Therefore, we must prove that the \Circus\ actions type defines a complete lattice. 
This leads to prove that the actions type belongs to the HOL ``\emph{Complete Lattice class}''. 
Since type classes in HOL are hierarchic, the proof is in three steps: first, a proof that the 
\Circus\ actions type forms a lattice by instantiating the HOL ``$Lattice~class$''; second, a
proof that actions type instantiates a subclass of lattices called ``$Bounded~Lattice~class$''; 
third, proof of the instantiation from the ``\emph{Complete Lattice class}''. 
More on these proofs can be found in \ref{ActionProofs}.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\Circus\ Processes.}{Circus Processes.}}

A \Circus\ process is defined in our environment as a local theory by introducing qualified names 
for all its components. This is very similar to the notion of $namespaces$ popular in programming 
languages. Defining a \Circus\ process locally makes it possible to encapsulate definitions of 
alphabet, channels, schema expressions and actions in the same namespace. It is important for the 
foundation of Isabelle/\Circus\ to avoid the ambiguity between local process entities definitions 
(e.g. \inlineisar+FIG.Out+ and \inlineisar+DFIG.Out+ in the example of 
Section \ref{Section:framework}).

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown for the language \Circus , which combines data-oriented modeling in the style of Z and 
behavioral modeling in the style of CSP, a semantics in form of a shallow embedding in Isabelle/HOL. 
In particular, by representing the somewhat non-standard concept of the \emph{alphabet} in UTP  in 
form of extensible records in HOL, we achieved a fairly compact, typed presentation of the language. 
In contrast to previous work based on some deep embedding \cite{ZC09}, this shallow embedding allows 
arbitrary (higher-order) HOL-types for channels, events, and state-variables, such as, e.g., sets of 
relations etc.  Besides, systematic renaming of local variables is avoided by compiling them 
essentially to global variables using a stack of variable instances. The necessary proofs for
showing that the definitions are consistent --- \ie{} satisfy altogether \inlineisar+is_CSP_healthy+ 
--- have been done, together with a number of algebraic simplification laws on \Circus\ processes.
 
Since the encoding effort can be hidden behind the scene by flexible extension mechanisms of the 
Isabelle, it is possible to have a compact notation for both specifications and proofs. Moreover, 
existing standard tactics of Isabelle such as \verb+auto+, \verb+simp+ and \verb+metis+ can be 
reused since our \Circus\ semantics is representationally close to HOL. Thus, we provide an 
environment that can cope with combined refinements concerning data and behavior. Finally, we 
demonstrate its power --- w.r.t. both expressivity and %the degree of achieved  
proof automation --- with a small, but prototypic example of a process-refinement. 

In the future, we intend to use Isabelle/\Circus\ for the generation of test-cases, on the basis of 
\cite{CavalGau:Acta:2011}, using 
the HOL-TestGen-environment \cite{brucker.ea:theorem-prover:2012}.
