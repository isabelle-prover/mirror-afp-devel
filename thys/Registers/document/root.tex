\begin{abstract}
  A formalization of the theory of quantum and classical registers as
  developed by Unruh \cite{unruh21registers}. In a nutshell, a
  register refers to a part of a larger memory or system that can be
  accessed independently.  Registers can be constructed from other
  registers and several (compatible) registers can be composed. For
  more details, see \cite{unruh21registers}. This formalization
  develops both the generic theory of registers as well as specific
  instantiations for classical and quantum registers.

  \textbf{Note:} This document assumes familiarity with the theoretical background developed in \cite{unruh21registers}.
  \cite{unruh21registers} also describes this formalization and mentions some of the design choices and challenges.

  Some of the theories are autogenerated (\textit{Laws\_Classical}, \textit{Laws\_Quantum}, \textit{Laws\_Complement\_Quantum}).
  Use the Python script \textit{instantiate\_laws.py} to recreate them after changing any of the theories starting with \textit{Laws} or \textit{Axioms}.
  See \cite{unruh21registers} for an explanation of this mechanism and the reasons for it.
