\title{Swap Distance}
\author{Manuel Eberl}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Given two lists that are permutations of one another, the \emph{swap distance} (also known as the \emph{Kendall tau distance}) is the minimum number of swap operations of adjacent elements required to make the two lists the same.

Equivalently, the swap distance of two finite linear orders $\preceq$ and $\unlhd$ is the number of disagreements of the two orders, i.e.\ of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $x\prec y$ and $y\lhd x$.

This article defines these two notions of swap distance as well as their equivalence under the obvious isomorphism between lists and linear orders given by interpreting a list as a \emph{ranking} of elements in descending order.

An efficient $O(n\log n)$ algorithm to compute the swap distance is also provided via the connection to the number of inversions of a list, for which an efficient algorithm is already available in the AFP.
