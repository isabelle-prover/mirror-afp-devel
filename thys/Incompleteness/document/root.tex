\title{G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson, with Janis Bailitis}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
G\"odel's two incompleteness theorems \cite{goedel-I} are formalised, following a careful presentation by {\'S}wierczkowski \cite{swierczkowski-finite}, in the theory of hereditarily finite sets. This represents the first ever machine-assisted proof of the second incompleteness theorem. Compared with traditional formalisations using Peano arithmetic \cite{boolos-provability}, coding is simpler, with no need to formalise the notion of multiplication (let alone that of a prime number) in the formalised calculus upon which the theorem is based.
However, other technical problems had to be solved in order to complete the argument.

L\"{o}b's theorem~\cite{loeb1955} states that, for a sentence $\varphi$ we have that $\mathsf{HF} \vdash \mathsf{PfP}(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner) \rightarrow \varphi$ implies $\mathsf{HF} \vdash \varphi$, where the formula $\mathsf{PfP}(x)$ is the standard provability predicate for $\mathsf{HF}$. It is a strengthening of G\"{o}del's second incompleteness theorem, which can be recovered via $\varphi := \bot$. The formalised argument follows a modern textbook presentation of L\"{o}b's~\cite{loeb1955} argumentation by Smith~\cite[pp.~255]{smith2020} via the Hilbert-Bernays-L\"{o}b derivability conditions~\cite{hilbert1939,loeb1955}. 
The formalisation is part of Janis Bailitis's Bachelor's thesis~\cite{bailitis2024}, completed at Saarland University in 2024.

Note: Janis Bailitis contributed L\"{o}b's theorem in May 2025.
