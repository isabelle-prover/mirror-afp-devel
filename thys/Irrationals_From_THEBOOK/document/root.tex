\title{Irrational numbers from THE BOOK}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
An elementary proof is formalised: that $\exp r$ is irrational for every nonzero rational number~$r$. The mathematical development comes from the well-known volume \emph{Proofs from THE BOOK}~\cite[pp.\thinspace51--2]{aigner-proofs}, by Aigner and Ziegler, who credit the idea to Hermite. The development illustrates a number of basic Isabelle techniques: the manipulation of summations, the calculation of quite complicated derivatives and the estimation of integrals. Unusually, the sum of squares method is used (\isa{sos}: to prove a polynomial inequality), and we also see how to import another AFP entry (Stirling's formula)~\cite{Stirling_Formula-AFP}.

As for the theorem itself, note that a much stronger and more general result (the Hermite--Lindemann--Weierstra\ss{} transcendence theorem) is already available in the AFP~\cite{Hermite_Lindemann-AFP}.
