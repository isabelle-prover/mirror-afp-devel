\title{A First Complete Algorithm for Real Quantifier Elimination in Isabelle/HOL}
\author{Katherine Kosaian, Yong Kiam Tan, and Andr\'e Platzer}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize a multivariate quantifier elimination (QE) algorithm in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Our algorithm is complete, in that it is able to reduce \textit{any} quantified formula in the first-order logic of real arithmetic to a logically equivalent quantifier-free formula. The algorithm we formalize is a hybrid mixture of Tarski's original QE algorithm \cite{Tarski} and the Ben-Or, Kozen, and Reif \cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/Ben-OrKR86} algorithm, and it is the first complete multivariate QE algorithm formalized in Isabelle/HOL.
