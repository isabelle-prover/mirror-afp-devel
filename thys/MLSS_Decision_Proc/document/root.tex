\title{A Verified Decision Procedure for a Quantifier-Free Fragment of Set Theory}
\author{Lukas Stevens}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This formalization verifies a decision procedure due to Cantone and Zarba for a quantifier-free fragment of set theory.
  The fragment is called multi-level syllogistic with singleton, or MLSS for short.
  Its syntax syntax includes the usual set operations union, intersection, difference, membership, equality as well as the construction of a set containing a single element.
  We specify the semantics of MLSS in terms of hereditarily finite sets and provide a sound and complete tableau calculus for it. 
  We also provide an executable specification of a decision procedure that applies the rules of the calculus exhaustively and prove its termination.
  Furthermore, we extend the calculus with a light-weight type system that paves the way for an integration of the procedure into Isabelle/HOL.
