abstract = """
This is a complete formalization of the work of Hoare and Roscoe on
the denotational semantics of the Failure/Divergence Model of CSP. It
follows essentially the presentation of CSP in Roscoe’s Book ”Theory
and Practice of Concurrency” [8] and the semantic details in a joint
Paper of Roscoe and Brooks ”An improved failures model for
communicating processes\".  The present work is based on a prior
formalization attempt, called HOL-CSP 1.0, done in 1997 by H. Tej and
B. Wolff with the Isabelle proof technology available at that time.
This work revealed minor, but omnipresent foundational errors in key
concepts like the process invariant. The present version HOL-CSP
profits from substantially improved libraries (notably HOLCF),
improved automated proof techniques, and structured proof techniques
in Isar and is substantially shorter but more complete."""
