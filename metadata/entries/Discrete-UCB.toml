abstract = "This project formally verifies the Discrete Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in Isabelle/Higher-order Logic (HOL), focusing on its probabilistic guarantees and regret bounds. The work extends Isabelle/HOLs probabilistic framework and explores verification of discrete-time bandit models following [1]. This research advances the formal verification of probabilistic algorithms in reinforcement learning."
