abstract = "We enhance rely-guarantee verification in Isabelle/HOL by extending the 2003 built-in library with flexible syntax, data-invariant support, and new tactics. We demonstrate our enhanced library by applying it to the examples attached to the original library. We also apply our library to three queue locks: the Abstract Queue Lock, the Ticket Lock, and the Circular Buffer Lock."
