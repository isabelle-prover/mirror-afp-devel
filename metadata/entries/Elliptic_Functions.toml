<p>
This entry defines complex lattices, i.e. $\\Lambda(\\omega_1,\\omega_2) = \\mathbb{Z}\\omega_1 + \\mathbb{Z}\\omega_2$ where $\\omega_1/\\omega_2\\notin\\mathbb{R}$.
Based on this, various other related topics are covered:</p>
<ul>
<li> the modular group $\\Gamma$ and its fundamental region
<li> elliptic functions and their basic properties
<li> the Weierstra√ü elliptic function $\\wp$ and the fact that every elliptic function
can be written in terms of $\\wp$
<li> the Eisenstein series $G_n$ (including the forbidden series $G_2$)
<li> the ordinary differential equation satisfied by $\\wp$, the recurrence relation for $G_n$,
 and the addition and duplication theorems for $\\wp$
<li> the lattice invariants $g_2$, $g_3$, and Klein's $J$ invariant
<li> the non-vanishing of the lattice discriminant $\\Delta$
<li> $G_n$, $\\Delta$, $J$ as holomorphic functions in the upper half plane
<li> the Fourier expansion of $G_n(z)$ for $z\\to i\\infty$
<li> the functional equations of $G_n$, $\\Delta$, $J$, and $\\eta$ w.r.t. the modular group
<li> Dedekind's $\\eta$ function
<li> the inversion formulas for the Jacobi $\\theta$ functions
</ul>
<p>In particular, this entry contains most of Chapters 1 and 3 from Apostol's
<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-0999-7\"><em>Modular Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory</em></a> and parts of Chapter 2.</p>

<p>The purpose of this entry is to provide a foundation for further formalisation of
modular functions and modular forms.</p>"""
