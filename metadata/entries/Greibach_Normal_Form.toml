abstract = """
This theory formalizes Hopcroft and Ullmanâ€™s algorithm to transform a set of productions into Greibach Normal Form (GNF). We
concentrate on the essential property of the GNF: every production
starts with a terminal; the tail of a rhs may contain further terminals.
The complexity of the algorithm can be exponential."""
