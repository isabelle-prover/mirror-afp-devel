<p>
This entry defines the <em>sum-of-squares function</em> $r_k(n)$, which counts the number of
ways to write a natural number $n$ as a sum of $k$ squares of integers. Signs and permutations of 
these integers are taken into account, such that e.g. $1^2+2^2$, $2^2+1^2$, and $(-1)^2+2^2$
are all different decompositions of $5$.
</p>
<p>
Using this, I then formalise the main result: Jacobi's two-square theorem, which states that for $n > 0$
we have \\[r_2(n) = 4(d_1(n) - d_3(n))\\ ,\\] where $d_i(n)$ denotes the number of divisors $m$ of $n$
such that $m = i\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 4)$.
</p>
<p>
Corollaries include the identities $r_2(2n) = r_2(n)$ and $r_2(p^2n) = r_2(n)$ if
$p = 3\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 4)$ and the well-known theorem that $r_2(n) = 0$ iff $n$ has a prime
factor $p$ of odd multiplicity with $p = 3\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 4)$.
