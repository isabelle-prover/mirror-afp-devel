abstract = """
We formalize the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, and related
material.  Specifically, we define the product of vectors in Hilbert
spaces, of operators on Hilbert spaces, and of subspaces of Hilbert
spaces, and of von Neumann algebras, and study their properties.

The theory is based on the AFP entry
<tt>Complex_Bounded_Operators</tt> that introduces Hilbert spaces and
operators and related concepts, but in addition to their work, we
defined and study a number of additional concepts needed for the
tensor product.

Specifically: Hilbert-Schmidt and trace-class operators; compact
operators; positive operators; the weak operator, strong operator, and
weak<sup>*</sup> topology; the spectral theorem for compact operators; and the
double commutant theorem."""
