This entry, derived from the <i>Isabelle Formalization of Rewriting</i>
  (<a href=\"http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/isafor/\">IsaFoR</a>), provides a formalized foundation for first-order
  term rewriting. This serves as the basis for the certifier CeTA, which is
  generated from IsaFoR and verifies termination, confluence, and complexity
  proofs for term rewrite systems (TRSs).

  This formalization covers fundamental results for term rewriting, as presented
  in the foundational textbooks by Baader and Nipkow and TeReSe.
  These include:
  <ul>
    <li>Various types of rewrite steps, such as root, ground, parallel, and multi-steps.</li>
    <li>Special cases of TRSs, such as linear and left-linear TRSs.</li>
    <li>A definition of critical pairs and key results, including the critical pair lemma.</li>
    <li>Orthogonality, notably that weak orthogonality implies confluence.</li>
    <li>Executable versions of relevant definitions, such as parallel and multi-step rewriting.</li>
  </ul>"""
