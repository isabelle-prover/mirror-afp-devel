<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2022.34\">Chakraborty et al.</a> published a streaming
algorithm (henceforth, the CVM algorithm) for the distinct
elements problem, that deviated considerably from the state-of-the art, due to its simplicity
and avoidance of standard derandomization techniques, while still maintaining a close to optimal
logarithmic space complexity.</p>

<p>In this entry, we verify the CVM algorithm's correctness using a new technique which simplifies
the analysis considerably compared to the orignal proof by Chakraborty et al. The main idea is
based on a probabilistic invariant that allows us to derive concentration bounds using the
Cram√©r-Chernoff method.</p>

<p>This new technique opens up the possible algorithm design space, and we introduce a new variant of
the CVM algorithm, that is total, and also has an additional property in addition to concentration:
unbiasedness. This means the expected result of the algorithm is exactly equal to the desired
result. The latter is also a new property, that neither the original CVM algorithm nor classic
algorithms for the distinct elements problem possess.</p>"""
