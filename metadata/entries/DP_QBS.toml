abstract = "This entry formalizes differential privacy using quasi-Borel spaces. In general, differential privacy is discussed using measurable spaces. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0960129523000245\">Sato and Katsumata</a> showed that quasi-Borel spaces are also applied to formulate differential privacy. We formalize basic definitions and properties of differential privacy using quasi-Borel spaces, and show two examples: randomized response and the naive report noisy max algorithm."
