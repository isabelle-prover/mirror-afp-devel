abstract = "Knowledge-based programs (KBPs) are a formalism for directly relating agents' knowledge and behaviour. Here we present a general scheme for compiling KBPs to executable automata with a proof of correctness in Isabelle/HOL. We develop the algorithm top-down, using Isabelle's locale mechanism to structure these proofs, and show that two classic examples can be synthesised using Isabelle's code generator."
